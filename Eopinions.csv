Auto, I have recently purchased a J30T with moderate miles  I shopped for a car that was looked after and paid more for it  As a former Auto Technician I know what to look for and what to expect yet every time I drive this car I say to my self  Dam that s a great car   and Yes I truly do  The car affords a level of style and comfort that is beyond compare for the price  I had looked at a number of J30 s with some having covered 160K miles   I checked them to see where the problems show  They were great other than just basic owner neglect The car is extremely quiet and smooth yet does not distance itself from a mild degree of sportiness  Performance is smooth yet impressive yet the power is well handled by braking and suspension systems of similar refinement The appointments available with the car were somewhat sparse yet the standard of quality and functionality were apparent  The Bose sound system for example has remarkable output and clarity without all the fancy dials  My only complaint  after 15k miles  is a lack of fold down rear seating and slightly high fuel consumption I went from driving a Porsche to the Infiniti and feel it was a step up in style and understated performance  
Camera, I bought this product because I need instant gratification  I can t stand the torture of waiting for my photos to come back from the lab  and I don t want to pay extravagant sums for one hour developing  The Sony Mavica is the perfect solution for the click happy shutterbug who likes to take lots of photos  but doesn t have an in home darkroom or an interest in the nuances of traditional photography The great thing about the Mavica is that you can take a photo and instantly see how it turned out on the built in color LCD display  If it sucked  take it again until you get it right  Non digital cameras don t come close to offering this feature With film  you take the photo and cross your fingers  If it s a one time shot  forget it  When you re using the Sony Mavica  you can try a variety of shots  with or without flash  and look at the photos until you get what you want  You can take black and white photos or add a  quot sepia quot  effect that looks like an old tyme photo that you get at the county fair A standard high density floppy disk is your  quot film quot  and holds about a ton of standard resolution photos  great for internet use  and half that amount of high resolution pix that you can print out on your printer One criticism that I have heard about this product is that it does not produce the glossy  permanent prints that you get when you use a film camera  If you are willing to spend some extra money  you can get a decent inkjet printer for a few hundred bucks that  when used with special photo paper  prints photos that look a lot like traditional prints  If you go this route and are willing to learn some software  you will get permanent prints that are superior to those that you get from the photo lab You can correct red eye and other common problems  adjust contrast and color just as you do on your TV  and even remove your finger or the camera strap from the shot  You can print wallets and 8 quot x10 quot s to your heart s desire without paying for reprints  The newer Mavicas can store a minute long MPEG movie  complete with sound  And like I said  the photo lab people never see your photos  Start your own  ahem  website  Ooh la la The fact that this camera uses floppy disks poses a problem for some computer owners  People with Windows based PCs generally have floppy drives and can use the Sony Mavica disks  The iMacs  however  don t come with a floppy drive  You ll have to shell out some extra bucks for one if you want to use your Mavica  since I don t think you can connect USB cables like with some other digital cameras If you do consider a Mavica  take note of the useful features that you get with the higher end models  and be sure to get a decent printer and some photo quality paper to get the most out of your purchase br br  
Auto, I have owned my Buick since 53000 km and I am now approaching 60000 on it  I must say it s the nicest car I ve owned and driven in a while  I previously owned a 1995 Grand AM which doesn t compare at all to the Buick  I have also test driven a 2002 Malibu  I have also rented a Lincoln Continental which I think is almost comparable to this vehicle  but not quite I was very pleasantly surprised by all of the basic features on this model  There is an indicator light for low fuel  low washer fluid  change engine oil soon  low tire pressure to name a few  As well  the three built in tether hooks in the back for car seats are a must have for me as I have two small children  I took a while to get used to the size of the car as I was previously in a smaller car  As well due to the high back  I m still not entirely comfortable when backing up  I tend to over estimate the size of the back  I would rate this vehicle average to above average on acceleration  Due to it s size and weight  it s not a sports car and I don t think it was meant to appeal to that type of consumer  I find that overall the Buick Century is easy to handle  It s a great car at a reasonable price  You can also read some more info on this car by copying and pasting this link to your browser http auto consumerguide com auto used reviews full index cfm id 2287 htm Happy car shopping  
Camera, This was my first Digital camera so I did quite a bit of research  Unfortunately  Pic quality is not everything as I found out  The camera is really cool and takes great pics but the viewer is a bad place  By that I mean that whenever I take a picture I leave a nose print on the LCD screen  It s also a drag to have to slide the lens protector back and forth to turn it on and off  One other big time bummer is that it doesn t come with an AC adapter  Fortunately  I have a SmartMedia reader so I don t have to drain my batteries while downloading pics  One other thing The manual is a damn shame  It looks as if somebody that was about to go on vacation wrote it  I can t recommend this camera because I m not in love it it I just own it  It wasn t a waste of money but If I know then what I know now I would have bought something else  Hope this helps  P S  The batteries It takes 4 AA batteries and it consumes them like mad  Invest in rechargeable is all I can recommend  
Camera, Minolta DiMAGE 7Hi is in a digital SLR with 5 megapixel 2 3  CCD sensor class  currently also populated by Nikon s Coolpix 5700  Sony s DSC F717  and Minolta s own DiMAGE 7i  Besides the high pixel count  these cameras  larger  better sensors and lenses  compared to 1 1 8  format and smaller digicams  result in better tonality  sharper images These days  it seems that digital cameras become obsolete the moment they are manufactured  Minolta DiMAGE 7Hi comes barely 6 months after the introduction of its similar looking sibling  the 7i What compelled Minolta to release an upgrade this soon  What makes the 7Hi stand out  Should you choose it or another camera in its class Minolta  one of the  big three  camera makers  besides Canon and Nikon  and the second most profitable one of the three  is the only one of the bunch that s been for a while without a digital 35mm format SLR body that would work with their lenses  Therefore  it appears  they feel the extra pressure to deliver viable  performance and cost wise  digital photography options to those of Minolta users who are advanced photographers This is very evident in 7Hi  It feels and works like a real photographic camera that happens to be a digital camera  as opposed to a digital age gadget that takes pictures that so many digital cameras are  Its performance  shutter lag  delay between you pressing the button and the camera taking the picture  frames per second speed and count for continuous shooting  time to ready after the shot  image retrieval  and focusing speed  are all at the top of its class   state of the art  7Hi s focusing system is fast and features an option for you to have the camera focus on any point in the frame   Things mentioned so far in this paragraph are all improvements on top of Minolta s own DiMAGE 7i s already impressive performance 7Hi s zoom control is a well dampened and smoothly operating ring that s mechanically linked to optical elements  allowing a very fast  precise  and tactile control of the focal length  By contrast  competitors in its class only offer a  zoom by wire   electronically emulated zoom ring  or  worse  T W zoom buttons  i e  camcorder style zoom controls  7Hi s high legibility display shows image histogram  distribution chart of light and dark parts in the image  in recording and playback modes  allowing you to monitor and optimize exposure  Its lens covers a span from the highly useful  relatively wide in 35mm film camera terms 28mm to the telephoto 200mm  with very little distortion throughout the range   Sony DSC F717 s lens only opens up to 38mm or so at the widest Overall the camera has a solid  quality feel  It comes from the shape and surface of the grip  and from how the various dials and controls operate  I ve played with the Minolta 7i and the Nikon 5700 at the store when I was picking the 7Hi  and to me  the 7Hi as a camera had the best feel of the three overall The camera works with Minolta s impressive flash system  including the powerful 5600HS  that even works wirelessly while preserving TTL   through the lens exposure metering  two excellent macro flashes  great for flowers   other close ups  and a cheaper and less powerful midrange flash  There s also a PC sync socket to trigger studio   generic flashes  no TTL with those though  but with a digicam  you do see the results right away  There are other features that are too numerous to mention here  that may come useful to some photographers Now that you know what s great about this camera  here s what isn t  There is some grain like noise evident in the images  This is especially visible when photographing smooth flat areas of a given color in subdued light  particularly if that color is blue  This is a typical and fundamental problem for all digicams  and I would say is not far out of line with the other prosumer 5MP SLR competition  but I wish 7Hi were the best in this regard as well  No video capture mode in the true sense of the word  I know it s a gimmick  but I like the idea of having a video mode on a digicam  even if it s a 320 x 240 pixels x 15fps for a few seconds  This camera s CPU speed and buffer size would with little doubt allow for at least 320 x 240 x 30fps or 640 x 480 x 15fps  both highly useful for the web streaming media  It s a shame that Minolta did not include this capability  they did provide 7fps capture at an even higher resolution  The capacity of the supplied CompactFlash card is pathetic  The camera battery performance  using the excellent NiMh batteries supplied with the product  is average by today s standards  I am typically getting around 200 shots per charge with my typical flash and AF use  and maybe 250 if no flash is used and no extensive focus   refocus   try again AF activity takes place  Fortunately  7Hi uses  4  AA s  so it is easy to get cost effective extra batteries  such as the ones recommended below  I wish they made the camera USB 2 0 enabled  It s USB1 1 only  like most other digicams Recommended accessories  Maha MH C401FS 100 min NiCd NiMh individual 4 cell charger  Maha 1800mAh NiMh batteries  2 or 3 sets ideal  Lexar 512MB 24X CompactFlash card

Auto, I had a 1984 Saab  a 1996 Saab and now a 1999 S3  One of the things I like the best about this car is the way it looks  which is what made me buy it in the first place While I love Saabs and the way they drive  the 93 is my fav so far  Saab has said there were 1000 changes from the 900 to the current model  One of the things I noticed is the handling  which is much tighter  Also  the ride is slightly less bouncy and more steady Saab has continued to put the ignition on the floor and it has lots of cool features   the heated seats  CD player  back wiper and weather radio  But perhaps the best part is the storage  I have moved in and out of college and grad school in Saabs  I have known people who have fit fridges and other large items in the back  And when those seats go down the large mouth can fit almost anything My mom continues to proclaim that the Saab is a fun ride  If you are not looking for a car that can hold five adults  what something that is cool looking with style and has lots of cargo space   check it out It also takes a beating  I was hit from the front and the rear at the same time during a Boston snowstorm and my car was the only one not on a tow truck br br  
Auto, Nissan has needed a redesign of the Sentra since 1997  that model was economical and affordable but difficult to look at  Along comes the fresh looking Sentra for 2000   and not a minute too soon  However  Nissan has taken that car a step further now offering many different models based on that one  well built and sporty canvas  The Sentra is available in SE  XE  GXE and SE R trim levels  Should you want to enjoy an affordable and sporty sedan while saving the planet  Nissan has you covered there as well  The Nissan Sentra CA  short for Clean Air  is an attempt to sell you the social consciousness of an electric car with the fun and convenience of a normal car   is there anything this platform can t do To the casual observer  the Sentra CA looks just like a normal compact car  Well  normal for Nissan  their cars do have a bit of style that seems to be missing in others such as the Corolla  Civic  Cavalier etc  Remember when the Nissan Maxima was advertised as a  four door sports car  and when magazine ads touted the old Sentra SE R as the spiritual predecessor to the Datsun 510 and BMW 2002  One can only hope Nissan is getting back to the good ole days of performance and style  Back to the Sentra CA  It looks like a normal car  with the exception of the large  clean air vehicle  decals stuck to the rear doors  Nissan says they can be  easily removed  but also points out that a least one customer was upset when the unsightly decals were removed without his her permission  Sounds reasonable  half the fun of buying an environmentally friendly car is letting everyone else know that YOU are not  part of the problem  How selfless Other than the decals  the Sentra CA is quite unremarkable  In fact the car is notable for it s unremarkable ness From behind the wheel  one would never suspect the space age technology being utilized under the hood  Double walled exhaust  quick catalyst warm up and a radiator that has a special coating which actually changes ground level ozone  smog  into oxygen   this car is cleaning the air   It also meets California s strict SULEV emissions requirements for the year 2004  Frankly the Sentra CA is the cleanest burning gas engine currently for sale  and most drivers will never sense anything different when compared to other compact sedans  The 1 8L engine produces 122 hp  that is 5 less than a non CA Sentra  but it s hard to notice on the road  Acceleration is adequate  but typically cars in this price range  about  15 000  are anything but powerful  Merging onto the freeway is no problem  can t wait for the Sentra SE R  Road noise is minimal for a small car  and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly  The main  or perhaps only  drawback to the Sentra CA is what seems to be a higher than normal overdrive ratio  At times the Sentra seems to bog down under light acceleration  my suspicion is that this is done purposely to keep engine RPMs down  thereby lessening emissions  Handling is precise and a huge improvement over previous Sentras  The Sentra has a sportiness to it similar to the Honda Civic  but which is lacking on the Corolla Inside the Sentra CA is a basic  normal car interior  Nissan has improved the materials used inside the Sentra  the overall look and feel is much more pleasing  The dash  audio controls  seats and gauges all have the look and feel of a car costing much more  AM FM CD is standard  but a cassette player is nowhere to be found  People do still listen to cassettes don t they  I must be getting old  The stereo actually sounds very good and rivals the stock stereo found in the Honda Insight and Civic  Button and switches fall nicely to hand  Nissan has included a nifty storage area on the top part of the dash  not so unusual  but this one is covered  Finally a place to keep sunglasses out of sight and out of the hot sun  Rear seat room is a bit cramped  but then again this is a small car  Overall  the 2001 Sentra CA is reasonably adequate car  It does everything it s asked to  and more  There really is nothing exceptional about this little car  and that is just how it should be  Many people don t want to ruin the environment  it s just that they want to not ruin the environment in as simple a way as possible  Nissan has answered the call  no charging stations  no limited driving range and no hassle  Besides  the Sentra is good looking car as well  What more could you ask   save the planet  don t look dorky  It s just that simple  
Camera, The 3040 represents a new advance in digital cameras  complete with super fast f 1 8 lens  tremendous range of practical user controls and  most importantly  fabulous pictures  Just finished two beautiful 5X7 portrait enlargements of the kids for framing that meets or beats the quality of my old Nikon 35 mm system  Photo quality being  after all  job one  the Olympus shines in that department  especially when using the higher quality photo setting  in Olympus parlance SHQ mode  Quirks abound  nonetheless  For seriously 35mm photogs  as I was in the digital dark ages  perhaps the single biggest adjustment on the 3040 and other digital cameras is the lag between pressing the shutter release and picture being taken  The 1 2 seconds delay  which can seem considerably longer  can interrupt the timing of shots but  with some practice  one learns to adapt and make do  A quirk more unique to Olympus the popping out of the lens upon turning the camera on accompanied by the popping OFF of the lens cap  should you forget to remove it yourself  is associated with a rather alarming but apparently harmless grinding sound  Solution  tether that cap to the camera with a cord that Olympus has  finally  provided  it was not on the original c 3030  and remember to simply pop it off each time you turn the camera on problem solved  More troublesome was the woefully inadequate download instructions in the otherwise fairly decent manual  which thankfully includes an index  Olympus actually has pretty good download instructions on their website  which they ll also send you if you email them  but I wasted many hours struggling to download before uncovering the elusive instructions online  Why they failed to include these instruction in the manual is a mystery that only Olympus can  and should  explain  And forget about getting a live person on the phone I tried multiple times for several hours without success  Once mastered  however  downloading via USB is a snap and works like a charm  The Camedia software is very rudimentary but easy to use and functional On to the good stuff the fabulous creative options  My favorites  35mm motor drive style setting  a tremendous advantage with digital enabling rapid shooting  a dozen shots in seconds  though not with flash  in which you can quickly discard the bad shots and keep the good ones great for shooting kids during those precious action moments  black and white or sepia  very cool if you re into that  five levels of picture quality  memory eating SHQ is superb  can get 20 SHQ shots on 32mb card  control of flash power  aperture shutter speed manual settings  ISO  film speed equivalent  settings  auto manual spot focus choices  and a great touch for photographers interested in such details you can see key information  F stop  shutter speed  ISO  on the monitor screen accompanying each picture for a few seconds  should you choose to  More good stuff  the fast f1 8 lens allows for more available light shots without flash and greater ability to throw the background out of focus for softer  more appealing portraits  Batteries  Picked up four NiMH with charger for about  25 at Radio Shack still going strong after two days of extensive use  The camera body feels right  at least in my hands good weight  balance  and is just small enough to stick in a pants pocket should you choose to  Best of all  picture quality  including incredible enlargements  The c 3040 in SHQ mode can produce 8X10 portraits of quality sharpness and color  totally suitable for framing and displaying  If you re looking for high quality photos  fast lens  user friendly body and are willing to live with a few minor quirks  you d be hard pressed to beat the c 3040 at this price point  
Camera,    From Olympus to Kodak  b I enjoyed using an Olympus d450z for about a year  read my detailed epinion on this product to know more  but I eventually wanted a camera that would Give  easier access to manual functions   because the numerous steps needed to bypass the automatic functions of the d450z led me to use it like a point and shoot most of the time Offer a  direct USB connection  to download photos to my desktop and notebook Be more  sturdy   the lesser the plastic  the better Translate  accurate colors   my Oly d450z always had a blue tint Be  widely available   so that an eventual repair wouldn t leave me without a camera for months  which was unfortunately the case in my previous experience with Olympus Having access to higher resolutions  such as 3 1 mega pixels  wasn t an incentive to change my camera  but I eventually came to the conclusion that it sure wouldn t hurt if I ever want to have some of my works printed out After many price and features comparisons  I chose the Kodak DC4800  I waited to use it extensively before writing about it here  After two months of usage  I think I m ready to share my thoughts with you b  A success in design and ergonomics  b The DC 4800 s design is  in my opinion  a real achievement in ergonomics  All the accessible buttons are well placed on the casing  so you don t constantly have to look at what you re doing  after just a few minutes playing with it  your fingers will do the working The casing feels very solid  but the two plastic doors  for connectivity and the memory card  looks like they could break at any time  Also  the only button that I don t like is the power button  you have to push it very hard and low  probably to prevent unintended shutdowns or powering  and I personally prefer when electronic material that reacts to a light touch You could pretty well use this camera as a point and shoot if you d like to  But as the widely used manual settings have been put on the casing of the camera  you ll enjoy manually overriding the automatic settings  And contrary to many point and shoot  you don t constantly have to browse through a hierarchy of menus to set it up  Here are the functions accessible manually b Self timer   to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself b Burst mode   to take 4 pictures in sequence  at the lowest picture quality  you can take up to 16 b Landscape   to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus b Close up   To let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0 7 2 3 feet in great details   b Flash and flash settings   Will let you chose between flash  no flash  red eye b Exposure compensation   from  2 to  2  This will let you chose to over  or underexpose your subject  to adapt to various light conditions b Aperture   f 8  f 5 6  f 2 8  You can decide on the depth of field  so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos  You can also choose P for the automatic settings to take over b Zoom  in out  You get a 3x physical zoom  and also a 2x digital  which adds up to the 3x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough  You could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode  to prevent yourself from using it  I have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom  they re always grainy  not only with the Kodak s digital zoom  but with all those I tried I would have liked to access the ISO settings and exposure modes manually  but these have been put on menus accessible on the LCD  Also  the optical viewfinder could be a little bigger b  Limited memory for your memories  b The Kodak DC4800 comes with a 16 mb Compact Flash memory card  which is a complete nonsense for a 3 1 mega pixels camera  At 3 1 MP  you ll be able to fit  1  yes  ONE  uncompressed picture on it  If you compromise and add compression  you ll have 15  light compression  or 32  high compression  You could also choose to use less mega pixels  then you d fit  21   2 2  28   1 6 and 47   0 8 Needless to say that you ll soon have to consider adding another Compact Flash to your starting kit  I personally went for 48 mb  on which I can fit 5 pictures   3 1 uncompressed mega pixels  I rarely use it  48   3 1  light compression  63   2 2  85   1 6 and 143   0 8     Vivid colors and great details  b Let me now get to the main point of interest  picture quality  Kodak s digital pictures are known for their vivid colors  and the DC4800 reaffirms this reputation  The default color mode setting is at  saturated  which contributes to the vivacity of the colors  If you prefer  you can go for the normal mode  or even shoot in black and white or sepia You can also adjust the white balance manually  which will sure be very useful as I live in a country of snow  I m in Qu bec  I still have to experiment with this function  though  because I sometimes end up with a greenish tint on my photos when I override the default white balance settings Also  the 3 1 mega pixels will give you incredibly crisps and sharp details  even if you use low compression  but you ll eventually lose it if you use a high compression mode  which I don t recommend  The most annoying problem I had so far with the DC4800 is its inability to focus in low light conditions  It rarely focuses on the subject I want to photograph  but looks for any source of light and focus at that point  It gets annoying to have sofas and tables focused when people around are all blurry  As for the flash  it doesn t wash the picture as much as my Olympus  did  but still  I don t like using it  preferring to play with ambient lighting     Batteries down  down and down again  b My main complaint with the DC4800 goes to the battery  While AA NiMh rechargeable batteries in my Olympus d450z lasted for hours and hours of shooting with the LDC screen always turned on  Kodak s proprietary Li Ion battery that s used in the DC4800 doesn t impress me at all  If I keep the LCD on  it doesn t last more than 40 pictures  after which the LCD turns itself off  I can keep shooting without it for a while  but I don t like it at all  first  the optical viewfinder is too small  second  some of the main functions such as the ISO metering  shutter speed and white balance  are only accessible through the LCD screen  I suggest investing in an extra battery  consider the kit that includes a charger  it s 10  more than buying the battery alone  and it will recharge your batteries in 40 minutes  there s also the DC4800 expansion kit that will include the battery and charger  plus a decent carrying bag  a cleaning lens pen and an inkjet sheets sample pack   that s the one I chose and I m happy with it  The charger is very portable  and it won t be a problem to carry it around in your camera bag b  A few words on accessories  b b Neck strap   Useful to prevent dropping the camera  but it is so I d prefer a wrist strap  If you plan on using it  be careful  though  that the LCD may get scratched if you have hard buttons on your chest   b Lens cover    It falls down pretty easily  so you might want to consider fixing it to the casing with a small cord   b Lithium ion battery   This is a proprietary format  which is apparently also used in some other brands  so if you go on a trip b AC adapter for in camera charging   This takes very long  up to 4 hours  I strongly recommend buying a kit including a fast charger and an extra battery b USB cable   Perfect to transfer the pictures to most recent computers  Mac or PCs b Video out cable  for viewing pictures on TV  Never used it b KODAK software   It installed like a charm on my desktop computer  but my Sony Vaio couldn t go through the whole installation  I ended up installing the drivers manually  searching for them on my desktop and copying them one by one on the Vaio  Painful operation  but it now works perfectly on both computers  When evaluating the cost of the DC4800  consider you ll very soon what to buy these extra accessories b High capacity Compact Flash memory card   consider at least 48 mb b Expansion pack for the DC4800   item 1174770   100  You ll get Li Ion Battery  Li Ion Battery Charger  Premium Camera Bag  Inkjet Sample Pack  5   4 x 6 sheets  and a Lens Pen  You could also go only for the battery  70  the battery and charger  80  As you can see  for only 20  more  you get quite a lot with the Expansion pack  which I recommend strongly You may eventually consider buying extra lenses  in which case you ll also need to spend 25  on the lense adapter  it came as a promotion with mine  
Camera, Many years ago  I was deeply in 35mm photography  I had a full gadget bag with several lenses  filters  sunshades  reflectors  flashgun  tripod  exposure meter and of course several different cans of film  I also had a darkroom with an enlarger and all the chemicals and trays  I even had a developing tank and a place to hang drying prints  Now all this was just for black and white photography  Today  I ve replaced all that with a few ounces of fully integrated digital camera that easily fits in a pocket  The film is now a mini disk about the size of a postage stamp  My PC has replaced the dark room  I no longer have to buy film or chemicals or flashbulbs  And best of all  I can view my pictures in full color in minutes  edit them quite rapidly and share them with friends and family around the world almost instantly  I am a true believer in modern photographic technology Digital cameras seemed to come in two flavors  low cost toys and high priced professional tools  Now one of the premier camera manufacturers  Olympus  has released an affordable  full featured camera  the D 360L  that has evolved from their successful D 340R film less Digital Camera  This is not just a low cost version of the award winning D 340R  but the D 360L is a completely redefine the entry level class camera  The street price is less than  300  and amazingly it has all the convenient features you need in a film less digital camera  including a compact  lightweight design  low price  all glass aspherical lens system  and 2x digital telephoto mode  Its features compare quite favorably with cameras costing twice as much or more  The picture quality results from the 1 3 mega pixel CCD  charge coupled device  array  that functions much like a scanner  There are several choices in mode of picture quality  again analogous to a scanner that allow you to choose between quality level and the number of pictures that can be stored  There is an 8 MB  smart card  replaceable media memory card that stores the pictures and is in essence  the film  This smart card has panoramic capability so that you may take panoramic photos  There are cards of various capacities available that range up to 32 MB  The included 8 MB card can store up to 122 pictures  depending upon the quality level selected  For example  Standard Quality  640 X 480 pixels  can have up to the 122 pictures while Super High Quality  1600 X 1200 pixels  can have as few as 2 pictures stored  There are several choices in between  Again  think of your scanner and the pictures produced by the different quality settings  Standard features include selectable ISO ratings  exposure compensation  selectable digital  ESP  matrix  spot metering  auto or preset manual white balance  two compression ratios in Standard Quality mode for more imaging options  and a six mode automatic flash with a new slow synchro flash The auto flash system automatically fires in low light and the fill in flash can fire with every shot  erasing shadows and providing balanced illumination There is an LCD  liquid crystal display  monitor that you can use to show a WYSIWYG  full color view of the picture that you are about to take  You may also view all the pictures stored in the camera on this monitor  Individual pictures can be erased and the memory space released for another shot  Try that with film  You may choose to conserve battery power by turning off the monitor and using the optical viewfinder to frame your picture  There are auto focus marks within the viewfinder to help compose the picture  Just press the shutter release half way and you lock in the focus and exposure settings  A green light tells you when the camera is ready to press the shutter release all the way to capture the picture  It s hard to go wrong  since you need keep only the photos that you want Other features include  sequential shooting  a shutter release timer  date time imprinting capability and picture indexing  It is hard to imagine any normally useful feature that has been omitted  And best of all  they all work as advertised The control panel shows you the camera status  including the state of battery charge  the number of storable pictures  the flash mode  the quality level  the white balance setting  the self timer setting  the spot metering mode  the shooting mode  and just about all the operating parameters and settings  There is no guesswork  you are always presented with all the information  The batteries can be 4 AA alkaline  4 NIMH batteries  AA lithium batteries or AA NiCd batteries  You have a full range of choices The standard package includes  the camera  an 8 MB smart media card  a wrist strap  4 AA batteries  a CD containing the Camedia software  a great fully illustrated manual

Auto,    General Trooper Information  b The Isuzu Trooper has been produced for over twenty years worldwide  and is respected in many countries for it 146s off road prowess and reliability  Sadly  it hasn 146t received such a warm welcome in the United States  and was canceled in 2002  There 146s only one thing I blame for the downfall of the Trooper  and that would be the Consumer Reports hack n slash job on the 1996 Trooper  Their story was the ultimate Naderism  and caused such a furor that sales on the Trooper fell abysmally  After various strategies and incentives failed  Isuzu canceled the Trooper in 2002 due to lack of sales volume The 1994 Trooper I own is considered a 3rd generation model  and it was produced from 1992 until 1997  There were several option packages available  from the basic Trooper S up to the fully loaded LE  Just as the  a href content 82526768772 b Rodeo  a  was cross branded as the Honda Passport  so the Trooper was marketed as a Acura SLX  You 146ll find the same powertrain and most interior pieces are the same between both models  Since the resale value on both models is about the same  you may want to look for an Acura since they did have more gadgets and marginally upscale interiors  The Trooper is much easier to locate since they sold at a much faster rate than the SLX b  My Trooper Experience  b My Trooper is a 1994 Trooper S V6 with the 5 speed manual transmission  It has only the standard options  which makes it quite loaded by 1994s standards  It had 89K miles when I purchased it  and was it very good condition  I have since added an alarm system  remote keyless entry  custom wheels and tires  and an upgraded stereo system b Overall Appearance  I really like the way the 3rd generation Trooper looks from every angle  especially my all white version  The LS models had two tone paint jobs  with the bumpers and lower cladding a different color  The overall look is tall and muscular  with the obvious priority being interior space  From the back the Trooper looks quite large  as the rear door area is quite square  The side view puts this SUV in better proportion  as you can see the large hood offsets the bulky body  The only ugly parts on a stock Trooper are those hideous wheels  I really wonder what some manufacturers are thinking when they specify wheels for a new model   147Well guys  we know people will never agree on what looks great on our new SUV  so why don 146t we choose the most ugly wheel in our catalog  Then they 146ll HAVE to buy new rims 148 Isuzu should take notice of the wheels Jeep puts on their Grand Cherokee and Wrangler models  subtle yet stylish  The wheels on the Trooper are dished inwards  and look like an oversized pie pan only inverted  I chose to add  M B  Motoring  Shock wheels in a 7 5 148 x 16 148 size  These put my tires about 1 5 148 wider on each side  and let me fit 245 75 16 Nitto Terra Grappler tires without a lift and still have no rubbing  The rims and tires are obviously not necessary  and were purely personal preference  I will say my Trooper looks much nicer with its new wheels b Interior Appearance   Comfort  The inside of the Trooper takes a little while to get used to  For one thing  a 6 146 tall man will have 6 7 148 of room above his head when he sits down  This SUV does have loads of head room  and a very generous amount of leg and knee room as well  This goes for the back seat too  and the rear seat is also wide enough to seat two adults for any length of time in comfort  For some reason the front seats are slightly firmer  and give you better support over long distances  On a 1300 mile trip this fall  the back seat passengers were always asking to stop before the front seats  As I said before  it 146s not the room that is the problem  but more the composition of the seat material The dash controls are laid out in an fairly accessible manner  and most functions are easily reachable without focusing on them too much  The learning curve for the controls can be steep for those of us used to American vehicles  The main problem you might run into will involve the wiper and headlight controls  For some reason  Isuzu decided to put them both on the dash instead of the steering column where God intended them to be  After almost 10 000 miles of being the sole driver of my Trooper  I still turn off my headlights when I mean to turn off the wipers  It doesn 146t help that they are both exactly the same size and shape  A lesser annoyance is the placement of the main cruise switch and the rear wiper switch  They are placed on either side of the steering column on the dash  and right behind the steering wheel spokes  You have to feel around for them at night until you are familiar with their location Now for the good points  the 5 speed shifter feels very smooth for a truck transmission  One thing that seems so unimportant but which I 146ve really come to enjoy are the pull handles on all five doors  Just slide your hand into the handle and pull out  no thumb jamming or button pushing required  I also appreciate the lighted window switchgear  it 146s a nice touch for those dark nighttime drives  Standard power mirrors are a nice feature on any base model SUV  but Isuzu went the extra mile with heated and folding mirrors  The heaters are selectable with a handy on off switch  and those narrow garage doors are easier to navigate when you push the mirror button and watch the mirrors fold into the door  Power locks allow you lock or unlock all five doors from the driver 146s door  and simplify the entry of multiple passengers  Fit and finish on the interior materials is mid level at best  but still acceptable for a mid 90s SUV  The cloth is a very stain resistant material  and much nicer in cold weather than leather  The interior of most Troopers will be the dark gray theme of my truck  and it 146s great for those too lazy to clean  Tan and black both show the dirt much worse than gray  so three cheers for monochromatic color schemes  I really prefer the lower end interior trim instead of the fake wood and rabbit fur trim on the  147high end 148 LS  I 146m driving an import SUV thank you  not my grandparents Olds 88 Regency Brougham  Since I don 146t have kids of my own  I can 146t comment on child seat installation  but the rear doors do open wide enough to comfortably stand in the opening to position your kidlets in their seats  The 3 rd gen Trooper is too old to be equipped with the LATCH child seat system  so you 146re stuck with the old seatbelt rigmarole The rear seatbacks are adjustable  which is a rare feature in this class of SUVs  They recline far enough to get comfortable and rest  To fold the seats down  you only need pull the recline button and move the seatback forward  This will bring the seatbacks to a level position  but they most definitely don 146t fold into the floor  You 146ll have to wrestle with the seat bolts and remove both rear seats for maximum cargo capacity  This isn 146t a job you want to assign to your wife  since both rear seats are heavy and bulky  Normally this isn 146t a problem  since there is a large amount of storage behind the upright seats  The rear doors are of the 2 3 1 3 variety  with the larger left door opening first  This is preferable to the  147dutch 148 doors on Suburbans and Astro vans  Usually I only need to open the left door  so access is easy with the large opening  There is a latch on the bottom that locks when the door is fully open  which is useful on a hill or when it 146s windy outside b  Performance   Handling  b The stock 3 2 liter V6 is adequate for everyday duties  and is surprisingly gutsy up to 35 mph  The 188 ftlbs of torque are to thank for the Trooper 146s low end grunt  but 175 hp isn 146t quite enough for this 4 300 lb truck to cruise comfortably on the freeway  The onramp acceleration speeds are acceptable  but nothing to write home about  Above 75 mph the Trooper 146s design elements begin to work against it  Its boxy shape gives it a lot of cargo room for its size  but also endows it with the aerodynamics of a barn  Side winds buffet the Trooper slightly more than other SUVs  although it feels unsettling more than dangerous  After driving my Trooper at least 5 000 interstate miles I 146ve found it rides better with a medium load  which is evidence of the truck based body on frame design  I can say the Trooper rides much nicer than Isuzu 146s  a href content 82526768772 b Rodeo  a  mostly due to the coil sprung rear axle  Coil springs generally give a more progressive suspension movement and a better  more compliant ride  This is definitely the case with the Trooper  and this helps to keep the hideous potholes at bay on the frozen roads of the Midwest  Brakes have an excellent feel  and stop predictably when needed  Braking distances seem to be average for an SUV  although 4 wheel anti lock was only an option in 1994  Handling is better than you would expect for a vehicle of the Trooper 146s size and height  While it does have a large degree of body roll  it will stick to a corner at much higher speeds than most will want to attempt  Slalom type maneuvers are accomplished with moderate body sway  and a little drivetrain shudder  The emergency lane change was where Consumer Reports nailed the Trooper for rolling over  and this was later proven to have been a biased report  Other auto magazines attempted to recreate this situation  and failed to achieve a rollover  While this is essentially a truck  and it has limitations like all SUVs  I don 146t consider the Trooper any more prone to rolling than any other SUV of the mid 90s  One more thing  the 1998 2002 models were heavier and consequently had a higher center of gravity  so the earlier models aren 146t as top heavy as the newest generation  I would choose the 5 speed manual transmission over the automatic for this vehicle  since the auto robs more power from the merely adequate engine  It also does not shift quickly or firmly  and feels very sluggish in city traffic b  What About The Competition   b The Trooper 146s main competitors are the Toyota 4Runner  Jeep Cherokee  Ford Explorer  and Chevrolet Blazer  The 4Runner is admittedly a better vehicle  both in fit   finish and in quality  The 3 0L six cylinder engine is comparable in both power and real world performance  It 146s definitely smaller inside  so both passenger and cargo space suffer  It also costs up to twice as much used as a Trooper  You get what you pay for  so for those on a budget the Trooper is going to look better Jeep has been working on its Cherokee model for almost 20 years  so even in the mid 90s it was a well sorted out vehicle  I 146ve had the pleasure of riding in several Cherokees  and these are my conclusions  The Cherokee is by nature a better off road vehicle  and can tackle incredibly difficult terrain in stock form  It has a better auto transmission  and when equipped with the 4 0L inline six will perform very well both on the highway and in the city  Where it falls behind everyone else in this class is interior refinement  A 1994 Cherokee still feels very much like a truck inside  and rides like one too  For a family that needs 4WD and a strong frame based vehicle  the Cherokee deserves a close look  Anyone that will see most of their miles on the highway should head towards a 4Runner or Trooper  which are both better asphalt SUVs I haven 146t owned a mid 90s Ford Explorer  so I can 146t give you factual data for a comparison  I do know some casual friends that have owned them  and reactions are mixed  While cheap to repair like most American made vehicles  90s Explorers will be having more than their share of breakdowns by this time  and this is proven by their poor reliability scores  They also have a propensity to rust under the doors and around the rear wheels  I would personally recommend the Explorer to someone The GM Blazer Jimmy twins were always popular in the northern states due to their relative low cost  and the fact they were available in 4WD and several body configurations  While they do carry a reliability history somewhat better than the Explorer  it 146s still a notch below Jeep and the imports  Many of the interior features feel  147cheap 148  even on upper end SLT models  For some reason GM can 146t seem to design a seat that is comfortable for long distances  or include heated   folding side mirrors    one point for Isuzu   The GM twins strong point is definitely their 4 3L V6 and transmission  If you like speed and need to tow a reasonable sized trailer  take a closer look at the Blazer Jimmy twins b  Trooper Negatives  b It 146s not all roses for the Trooper  and there are some rather annoying issues that plague other Isuzu models  The geriatric 3 2L engine is actually sourced from GM  and is not what anyone would describe as a modern powerplant  It has a notorious valvetrain ticking problem that while not a true reliability problem  it can be downright annoying  Another problem that has plagued both my  a href content 82526768772 b Rodeo  a  and Trooper is poor quality lock cylinders  These locks just won 146t work right  and replacement is somewhat expensive  You must resort to unlocking other doors and reaching across the truck  or get the cylinders replaced  Since the Trooper and the  a href content 82526768772 b Rodeo  a  share the same manual transmission  it 146s no surprise they share the same parts failures  The slave cylinder for the clutch apparently fails at around 70 80K miles  and slowly leaks until your clutch won 146t disengage  This is exactly the opposite of how a bad clutch feels  when the slave cylinder fails you can 146t get your truck out of gear  You can put a band aid on the problem by having someone  147bleed 148 your clutch line and get all the air out  Eventually you 146ll need to fix it for good though  and it should cost between  250    350 to get it repaired Gas mileage is surprisingly bad for my Trooper  and I average 14 mpg  I was getting around 12 for most of the summer  until I put my tires up to their max air pressure  Now I 146m getting closer to 17  with a few dips down to 13 or 14  This can 146t be considered good mileage by any means  and you don 146t get the power of a V8 that the mileage suggests you would  I attribute most of this to the lower gearing and aforementioned barn like aerodynamics  The last problem I must mention is the timing belt noise  If a Trooper you own or one you are looking at has a loud clacking or tapping noise  it could be the timing belt tensioner  This is a common problem with these engines around 100K miles  and should be replaced whenever you have your timing belt replaced  The tensioner is a hydraulic dampened spring that keeps pressure on your timing belt  this removes any slack from the belt and prevents it from jumping on the pulleys  The hydraulic portion fails after so many miles  and causes the tensioner to cycle in and out rapidly  This can sound just like an engine bearing or rod slapping  but is significantly cheaper to repair  Depending on labor costs  you are looking at  350 to  500 for timing belt and tensioner replacement b  Final Comments  b Even though the above negatives may sound daunting  you must remember that every brand and model has their own chronic defects and failure areas  The Isuzu 146s are usually very reliable  and if something fails it 146s usually a part that won 146t leave you stranded  If I had to do it all over again  I would still buy my Trooper  even with its little quirks  I have enjoyed the storage and passenger capacity the Trooper offers  There are several useful Isuzu forums if you have questions about your Trooper  although the Isuzu dealer network is sorely lacking  I wouldn t say the Trooper is for everyone  but I would give it a strong look along with the other SUVs I have mentioned  The Trooper pulls ahead of its competition in the areas of value and cargo space  Check out the fanatics at the Isuzu Trooper Owners Guild if you want more info on Troopers http www

Camera, While more than a year old   it came out in early 1998   the Olympus D 340L has been one of the better buys I ve made in the last two years  The image quality is impressive  with color handling that matches any similarlly priced standard hand held camera  The cameras high quality function  a resolution of 1024 768  makes for fantastic prints when coupled with Epsons photo quality glossy paper Connecting the camera to your computer or your TV is also easy  with all of the connections housed on one side of the camera On the negative side  the Camera s computer based software is quirky and very slow  The images are also compressed with a propriatary form of JPEG  meaning that they should be resaved once they are downloaded to your machine  opening them directly opens the Camera software  which then searches for the Camera   a process that takes roughly a minute  My problems with the software may have been caused by my use of a Macintosh  but I can t be sure All in all  while the software does have its drawbacks  the quality of the images makes up for them p  
Camera, My boyfriend bought this camera last year  and it is the best I have used yet  The picture quality is great clear and not choppy like a lot of other cameras  It also loads the pictures fast  so you don t have to worry about moving the camera around after the picture has been taken Installing this camera is so easy  that anyone can do it  It uses a USB connection  which saves a lot of time  Included is a cd with everything you need including drivers and help files Not only does the camera take great pictures  it has a lot of wonderful added features such as borders  great for wedding  baby  birthday pictures  flash  zoom  and a timer  great for taking pictures of yourself The only weakness the camera has is the life of the batteries  which is not all too important since it comes with a charger and rechargable batteries  
Camera, I really love this camera  I am a graphic designer who creates photo calendars  photo business cards  etc  Playing with photos is my passion  But I always hated taking pictures and waiting until the roll was used up before I could develop them  Then I had to wait another day for developing  Finally  I had to scan the pictures into my computer before I could begin working on a photo project Not so with my Kodak DC215 Zoom  I can take one picture  or 75 pictures at a time  The camera has a review screen  so that if a photo does not come out well it can be deleted immediately  no more developing over  or under exposed photos  At any point  I can plug the memory card into a mouse sized USB CF Reader that transfers my pictures quickly and automatically into my computer  where they are ready to print We really enjoyed taking pictures after the birth of our daughter  and sending them by email to family and friends  The pictures printed beautifully as well Here are some of the camera s specifications Megapixel picture resolution  1152 x 864 pixels color LCD 4 flash modes  auto  fill  red eye  off 10 second self timer JPEG or FLASHPIX image files optional date stamp etc It comes with the follwoing wriststrap and lenscap USB COMPACTFLASH card reader COMPACTFLASH removable memory Camera specific software  as well as Adobe Photodeluxe and Pagemill  and Photo printer 2 0  Photoshop for Mac systems serial cable for Windows  adapter for Mac video cable batteries  quick set up guide  user s guide and registration card The camera also has lens kits and other accessories for purchase There are two minor drawbacks  After taking a photo  the camera takes a few seconds to process the image  so two photos cannot be taken quickly in succession  The camera also uses a lot of batteries  Fortunately  rechargeables can be used with this camera  or you can buy an adapter to plug into an outlet  
Camera, In this ever expanding digital world of ours  where free time is our most valuable commodity  one can get easily buried in the mass of information  specifications  pixelations and operations of the plethora of digital cameras that are available For many  where digital photography is a big part of their lives  choosing a suitable camera with a multitude of options and megapixels is a necessity  For others  who simply want to have fun taking pictures with a single  click  and easily upload those pictures to their PC for viewing printing emailing  the idea of spending hundreds of dollars on a camera they ll never fully exploit prohibited them from this digital realm But Polaroid knew there was a market out there for a low cost  moderately functional digital camera that could be accessible to everyone  After initially coming out with their 320 model digital camera which  for  20  offered a very poor digital photo  they ve re thought their method and direction and have come out with the  Fun  620 Digital Camera   The  Fun  620 Digital Camera  offers twice the resolution of their earlier 320 model   producing images of 640 x 480 pixel resolution  In the megapixel world  that equates to about 1 3 of 1 megapixel  That being the case  the images are adequate for viewing on the screen  but they don t print out with any level of quality that you would receive with a 2 1 or better megapixel camera  But that s really not the purpose of the  Fun  620 Digital Camera   It s more for having fun  emailing pictures  uploading them to your website and more  Want good quality printable digital images  Look elsewhere The  Fun  620 Digital Camera  has few features  but what it does have works well  There s a 15 second self timer which is easy to use  The optical view finder seems to line up the image accurately  An LCD display indicates how many images you have taken  maximum of about 15  whether the memory is full  and whether there isn t sufficient light to properly expose the image  And  of course  there s a delete picture button which works on a 3 second delay  as to avoid accidental deletions The internal memory  1 megabyte  isn t removable like other digital cameras  so the only way to extract the pictures are to hook up the camera to your PC and dump them  Connection to your PC is a snap with the included combination USB and serial port connector  Included with the camera is the appropriate driver software to allow you to retrieve the pictures  Saved as JPG files  Additionally  there s a nice  moderately powerful  image viewing editing software called PhotoMax  The low light indicator will still allow you to take a picture  however unless you have the camera mounted on a tri pod  or other stationary item  the image may come out fuzzy and or distorted  And since this camera doesn t come equipped with a flash  Model 820 does  you ll want to insure the camera is steady in those low light situations  Outdoors  in full light  the images are typically more vibrant and colorful   capturing a fair amount of details  Colors and flesh tones all seem pretty accurate with a decent light source The casing of the  Fun  620 Digital Camera  is made of a light weight  moderately durable silver plastic  For those of you who  like myself  equate heft in electronics with quality and durability  you ll know immediately that this camera does not contain either  A drop to the floor resulted in the battery compartment opening and the camera body itself splitting open  But everything snapped back together and the camera worked fine  so there is some durability here  Additionally  the style and grip of the camera are both ergonomic and comfortable The  Fun  620 Digital Camera  runs on 4 AA batteries  also included with the camera  and since there s no flash or color LCD display to drain their power  they should last for you hundreds of exposures  The auto off feature insures you don t drain the batteries unintentionally as well For around  30  the  Fun  620 Digital Camera  offers a fair amount of features and performance  Absent a flash and any zoom capabilities  this is a basic point and shoot digital camera that s a perfect way to break into the digital medium  or just play around with some low cost  fun digital photography The price certainly is right  And you get what you pay for Thanks  as always  for reading John 
Auto, Ten years ago  when Saturn opened its doors  few would have expected that the new company would be able to compete with the import cars that dominated the compact and subcompact world  Well  by designing a reliable  value priced car  and a friendly hassle free atmosphere in their dealerships  they not only survived  they changed the automobile industry Thanks to the reliability and lower cost of their vehicles  Saturn has a fiercely loyal customer base  Their problem in recent years has been that many of those customers had outgrown the compact car  and were looking for a midsize car  As one Saturn owner put it  Year after year  I visited the Saturn showroom and asked   quot So  do you have a bigger car yet quot  Year after year  the answer was   quot No  not yet quot Those customers had little choice but to buy a Honda  Ford  or Toyota  Now  at the beginning of a new century  Saturn has the daunting task of taking on some of the most popular vehicles in production today  the Toyota Camry  Ford s Taurus  and the Honda Accord  Enter the new  bigger Saturn L Series  Now car buyers have two more choices  the LS Sedan and LW Wagon  How good is the new Saturn  Were they able to design and produce a car that can compete in this group  We think they did very well  The new Saturns deserve to be taken seriously by car buyers who are looking for a midsize car The L Series may not turn heads with its understated styling  but it is sure to convince a lot of buyers with its features and price  Under the hood  you ll find either the peppy new 2 2 liter balanced shaft 137 horsepower 4 cylinder DOHC engine that will also be used soon in other GM cars  or the 3 liter 184 horsepower DOHC V 6 that is also used in the Opel Omega  Saab 9 5 and Cadillac Catera  Driving the car  whether it s the standard 5 shift or the automatic 4 shift is fun  It may be made in America  but it kept much of its European pedigree  We were more than pleasantly surprised on country roads and highways  It smoothes bumps  takes corners and accelerates in an almost sports car fashion Your family will find the interior to be very roomy in comparison to the other cars in the group  Front leg room and head room are excellent  Rear leg room is a little cramped  The large bucket seats are more comfortable than the old Saturn seats  and four adults can easily take a trip in the L Series  One of the comments we heard often from passengers was   quot Are you sure this is a Saturn quot The dash is clean and easy to understand  It only takes a few minutes before you are completely familiar with the buttons  information lights  and gauges  Placement of the controls makes it easy for the driver to make on the fly changes The 60 40 split folding seats allow you to expand the trunk s over 17 cubic feet of cargo space  The LW wagon  has over 29 cubic feet of space which expands to over 70 cubic feet with the seats down One area that Saturn has really improved on is the noise level of their L Series cars  The S Series cars were known to be very noisy  but that is not the case with the L Series  The V 6 engine runs very quietly  and the 4 cylinder has only a slight  quot buzz quot  when you accelerate  The cabin is well sound proofed   only some wind noises on the highway  Even the fan blows quieter that the fans on earlier Saturns There s no question in our mind that the Saturn has earned its place among the Accords  Camry s  and Taurus s  but will it have any features that will allow it jump past the competitors  Our answer is definitely   quot Yes quot  After you ve looked at all the features  test drove the various cars  and checked out the dealers  there is one very important difference  the Saturn L Series costs a lot less  The base LS sedan starts at only  15 450  the LS1  at  17 190  the V6 powered LS2 model starts at  20 575  and the LW wagons start at a base price of  19 275  We think the Saturn L Series will give the other mid size family cars a real run for the money  Your money that is  Now  what can we do with that couple of thousand bucks we saved  Kid s college education  Trip to Orlando  Pay off some bills  Wow  This is really fun br br  
Camera, I have used other digital cameras  Mavicas  and bought this one because it has a good list of features for a relatively low price  camera   32MB card   299US  dock   77US  Although I am fairly proficient with cameras and electronica I also was attracted to Kodak because I knew that my whole family would be able to use it with few problems  I love the still shots it takes  although the lag does seem a little long  I wish they would ve put a little rubber strip on the back for your thumb  as it feels like the camera s going to slip or get knocked out of your hand I couldn t get the install CD to work correctly on my Win98 machine  and I finally went through the CD directory structure and installed the various bits manually  but after I did I have had no complaints  It is awesome to be able to set the full camera in its dock  press one button and have everything automatically upload to the computer  I love it I have upgraded the camera s internal firmware from the Kodak website  and it went without a hitch  very easy  This did fix a frustrating problem with having low battery life  so now I only have one more complaint  which is the high resolution video quality  If the camera is set to take the best quality video  it will play over cable to your TV OK  but the MOV s are choppy like crazy on the computer  Once I set the video quality down to the smaller resolution my MOV s now play well  although it s a tiny image  My computer is Win98  400mhz  576 megs of ram  so I don t think my playback problems are computer related  but I m still searching for the answer on that one  
Auto, Lured by Zero interest rates I decided to buy a mini van in the  25 000  CND range  I picked the Caravan over the Venture or Windstar wanting to get the most up to date design Unlock the van with a third party remote release and open the driver s door  It s an easy step up to the highback bucket seat with fixed head rest  standard budget model  The seat is firm  but the bolstering in sparse   no power functions  Quality of materials is good  but plastiky The 3 3l V6 sparks up easily and revs quietly  The column mounted shifter drops the four speed automatic into drive with very minimal arm effort  Shifter is almost too smooth  making it a bit too easy to drop it into Low unintentionally Gauges are on a nice white background  but are obscured for tall drivers when tilt steering is down too low  Stalk mounted wiper switch turn signal works smoothly  Rear view mirros are power adjustable both sides The Caravan pulls away smartly  Tranny shifts smoothly as speed climbs  Steering is solid with little play  Bumps in the road are muted but not silent  No interior rattles  Doors auto lock at speed above 30kms   auto unlock when van is placed back in park Squeeze the throttle and the engine roars louder than I d expect  Acceleration is strong enough but runs out of steam above 4500 rpm  At 80kms the engine is turning over a lazy 1500 rpm  Wind noise is noticeable at highway speeds but not bothersome Non abs brakes have a firm pedal feel and strong stopping power  I have yet to attempt full lock up so I have no opinion about emergency stopping power  Discs front  drums rear  All season tires are average quality  handling and braking would probably improve with lower  fatter profile tires Six speaker single cd has surprising volume  but lacks true high fidelity   decent bass output  Other controls are good  but legacy design of rear wiper buttons always require a look to find  Don t understand why Dodge has one button that kills all the climate control functions  Fans are noisy even at the lowest setting  Heat and cooling functions are fast and efficient Pull over to let the kids out  Both sliding doors open easily  Access to two passenger middle seat is easy  but because seat back doesn t tilt  access to the rear most seat is tight and can only be accessed from passenger side Rear hatch door is huge  but opens easily unlocking when the power locks are released from driver or passenger door  or keyless remote  Since this is a short wheelbase Caravan  the room behind the rear seat is tight  but is still useful due to its height  A row of hooks for plastic grocery bags prevents spills on the way back home  Lots of luggage and full load of passengers may require rental or purchase of a roof luggage coffin  This model has a roof rack but is rated for only 150lbs Seats are heavy   two seater middle  three seater rear  to remove and should be attempted with two people to avoid personal injury  They pop in and out easily once positioned over the floor latches  Infant car seats tether to the rear of both benches easily  With the seats removed the carry capacity is excellent even for a relatively short vehicle  Interior lighting is excellent front to back  but opera lighting  though quick to extinguish  is gimicky and annoying when you want to get away quickly in the dark  Headlights illuminate well I cannot believe how many of this model of Caravan are on the road  I guess a lot of other people found enough positive features and performance to pick one up too  
Auto, Hee un day  Hund die  Hi un day  Hoon diey  150 buy yourself an Accent and you re letting yourself in for a lifetime of tongue twisting action  According to my old next door neighbor  who happened to own the brand back in its Gen  Park Cheobol prime  the correct pronunciation is  145Hee un dae 146  But then this is the same man who told me that Soju Kettles weren 146t alcoholic  that the meat I was eating was duck and that the Hyatt hotel was due for demolition any day  So who knows What I can say is that Hyundai have come a long way since their re badged Cortina leftover days and 1988 Seoul Sponsorship  I will never see another orange Pony and not think Flo Jo  Back then they were the cheapest transport you could imagine to get you from A to B with a minimum of fuss and comfort  They were 15 years ago what Tata are today  minus the Rover tie ins  and that was fine  Korean prices helped Korean cars sell and unlike American cars of the day they had the good sense not to explode when rear ended  These days they 146re still as cheap as Christina Aguillera after a few Baileys but they 146re striving for two things that the pop strumpet fundamentally fails to understand  They 146re looking for a modicum of class and the respect that might go along with it  Hyundai want to be about more than price  they want to be about more than value for inches  most of their cars are the biggest in their price range  and they want to be about more than 10 year   100 000 mile warranties  They want to be good cars  The nerve of these people Of course anyone who wants to make good cars moves to Europe and Hyundai are no exception  Which is where I have my first problem with the Accent  You see the Europeans like their hatchbacks  150 and the Accent was designed to be a hatch  Add the trunk necessary to shift any units in the US and suddenly you have something seriously ugly  It doesn 146t help that the transformation was done with the subtlety of a Michael Jackson surgeon  Fully trunked this is a car that does not rest easy on the eye  150 not since the sedan version of the Toyota Echo have I seen anything as ungainly  and I 146ve seen the Paris Hilton Sex Tapes So the car fails the first test its set  150 looking awkward  foreign and  admit it  kinda cheap on the driveway  The tiny 13 148 wheels don 146t help  failing to fill the arches and shod  Cinderella like  in a shoddy plastic  I have an very odd video only version of Cinderella  okay Climb inside and things get little better  Not only is it ugly but  unlike a transsexual hooker  it 146s poorly equipped   10k  the price of a good Brazilian female   male operation by the way  gets you a car with little more than a weedy radio   cassette player  a clock and as much shiny gray plastic as you could ever want  In defense of the car the dash is well screwed together and the radio is by Sony  It 146s also a radio made for people who have small pointy compasses rather than person sized fingers  150 the buttons tiny and virtually impossible to pinpoint  That 146s my only real complaint  What controls there are seem to be logically placed and showed no sign of breaking off in my hand as I tugged at them Start the car up and the 1 6L 16V engine sparks into life with a gruff but not unattractive note  Hyundai 146s have always had a bit of poke and the Accent is no 98 lb weakling 104hp and 106lbs of torque are more than adequate in a car this size  though to get to the maximum power you 146re going to have to rev a little harder than is comfortable  It 146s not at all bad though  a slightly raucous note giving it a edge of sportiness  The 5 speed manual box is sweeter than any I 146ve encountered from Korea too  150 less notchy than you 146d imagine and positive in the throw  Progress then is adequate if not swift and can be quite amusing if you 146re prepared to risk your eardrums and hold on for the red line  You 146re not going to be heal and toeing this one  150 but you feel as though you could  Both pedals are well weighted and positive Push hard on those brakes and the nose will dive  150 that 146s to be expected I suppose as is the body roll on less than tight corners  The skinny wheels give way a little early for my liking but then I drive somewhat more aggressively than the people for whom this car was intended and I 146m sure that under normal circumstance the whole thing is a decent balance of comfort and handling ability Should it go wrong there are 4 airbags   you can disable the passenger one should you be carrying kids but again that 146s about it  150 active safety is woeful  I haven 146t seen crash test ratings but the car feels quite solid  I 146d wager it would do okay Where the car plays its ace of course is with that warranty  150 a basic 5 yr  60 000 miles with roadside assistance to match  150 plus 10 years   100 000 miles on the drivetrain  It 146s the most remarkable thing about a car this unremarkable but then you get to thinking  With no revolutionary technology  no expensive bits and pieces and a minimum of wiring this is a car that 146s been tried and tested over the years  It 146s a simple package yes but it 146s one that works  Servicing costs are low as are costs of running  Insurance is peanuts and 33mpg isn 146t at all bad Which leads me to the horses for courses part of the review  The Hyundai accent is no looker and it 146s sparsely equipped but it does a job and it does that job well  It 146s cheap to buy  cheap to run and will keep going as long as you want to hold on to it  And for many people that 146s more than enough  Utilitarian motoring may not have been the order of the day but for now it 146s do nicely  
Camera, Have owned Kodak digital cameras for nearly 4 years and have used them to take over 1500 pictures  My last camera was a Kodak DC200  SEE REVEIW  that I bought refurbished from Kodak  I loved my camera  but as technology and times change  it was time for an upgrade  FINDING THE RIGHT CAMERA The main reason I wanted to upgrade was better resolution  My old camera was a 1 3 Mega pixel camera and I wanted one that had a better resolution  I knew from previous experience that I wanted to zoom lens on my new camera  I did some research and found out that digital zoom is okay  but optical zoom is better  I also wanted a camera that used compact flash memory cards because I could use the old cards from my previous camera and it is so easy just to slap a new flash card in after you have filled one with pictures  A few more features that I wanted were a delay7 timer and the ability to attach the camera to a tripod  I ll be honest  I went to ebay and started looking and saw prices and features all across the spectrum  I then decided to go back to an old friend at the Kodak refurbished digital camera section and found what I was looking for  the Kodak Dx 3600  The Kodak Dx 3600 2 2 mega pixel camera that has 2x optical zoom and 3x digital zoom  The camera has 8mb of internal storage and takes compact flash cards also  Included are a delay timer  tripod adapter hole and a LCD screen  One big plus for the Dx3600 was that the lens cap is built in  it was such a pain to remove the lens cap take your picture and then try and find the lens cap again with my old camera  I ve had the wind blow the lens cap away when I just set it down while taking a picture and had a child pick it up one time  I almost forgot to include that this camera can shoot small videos with audio in the QuickTime format  LIKES This camera takes great pictures  The highest resolution is 1800x1200  the lowest is 900x600  I also like the zoom lens  the digital zoom is okay but the optical portion is great  I like the video abilities of the camera a lot  The high video resolution is 320x240 and the low resolution video is 160x120  I have used it to send short clips to each of my child s grandparents and they absolutely adore it  The LCD screen is easy to use and is adjustable so that it isn t on all the time to conserve battery life  The setup menu is so simple that a child could have the camera setup in minutes and start taking pictures  Of course  this Dx3600 also comes with red eye flash reduction  a programmable flash  and a close up setting for small close up pictures  The Dx3600 downloads pictures very fast due to its USB int3erface  My old DC200 would take forever and this camera is very  very fast  DISLIKES Unfortunately there are few things that I don t really care for on this camera  The camera has a funny feel to it  I believe that the camera feels funny due to it being rounded in the front and not flat like my old camera  Another dislike is that Kodak only wants you to use lithium or CRV3 batteries in the camera  I ended up buying rechargeable lithium batteries that cost more than the alkaline rechargeable that was in the old camera  The biggest dislike is that Kodak didn t design an A C adapter for this camera  Kodak wants you to buy the Easy Share Docking Station to recharge the batteries and download the pictures at the same time  EASY SHARE DOCKING STATION The Easy Share Docking Station hooks up to your computer via a USB cable that is supplied with your digital camera  A set of Kodak rechargeable batteries are also included with the docking station to that when the Dx3600 is placed into the docking station the batteries are recharged  One touch of a button and the pictures are downloaded into your computer  I use Windows XP professional  SEE REVIEW  so I didn t load any of the Kodak software onto my computer  I like the Easy Share concept  but the Easy Share Docking Station is way overpriced  Kodak sells the docking station with a set of rechargeable batteries for  79 00  BOTTOM LINE I really like the Dx3600 more than I thought I would  The camera takes high quality pictures and video  Buy the Easy Share docking station and an extra set of batteries and this will be a great setup for almost every household UPDATE NEWSFLASH 12 AUG 02 I was looking at the Kodak Dx3600 on ebay and found out that Kodak is selling the refurbished cameras on their ebay store and the price for the Dx3600 was  199  I had paid  239 on the Kodak on line store  I shot Kodak an email asking for a refund of the difference of  40 and they said yes  If you want to buy this camera  Kodak s ebay store is the place to look  
Auto, First of all  this will not be a review containing horsepower information  0 to 60 stats  true gas mileage charts  etc  There are plenty of reviews out there that do a good job of covering that information  This is my female review of the 2002 Chevy Trailblzer  I knew I wanted my next car to be an SUV  Monitarily  I found myself looking into the Mini SUV market  I test drove the Ford Escape  the Jeep Liberty  the Hyndai Santa Fe  etc  But somehow last Feb  I found myself buying a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer  The 2002 Chevy Trailblazer is a completely new body design from General Motors  They must have seen the need to compete with the Explorer crowd and increase the size of the Blazer  The Trailblazer is in family of similar GM SUV s  GMC  Envoy  Olds  Bravada  Buick  Rainer  soon to come Getting into the Trailblazer  you feel like you are in a beast of a car  well coming from a Pontiac Grand Am  you do  There is plenty of legroom in the front and back  something the mini SUV s lack  The seats are big and comfortable  The dash isn t too over powering like some of the GM mini vans from the 80 s  You sit up pretty high Now for the test drive  I had a limited exposure to full size SUV s  I drove my friend s 2002 Envoy  her nails where wet  and another friend s 2002 Ford Explorer  he was under the influence  So I was pretty much an SUV virgin  It took a bit getting used to sitting up so high above everyone else  Turning was also a HUGE issue  I felt as if I was going to tip over with every corner I took  Luckily that feeling is now gone  and I haven t tipped it over I ve been told I m an aggressive driver   I like to get going as fast as possible  as soon as possible  Here I am  in a HUGE SUV with only a tiny V 6 engine  I ve always made sure my cars were atleast a V 6  My lovley 90  Olds I drove in high school had a beefy V 8  Now I d be lying if I said this thing flies off the line  Don t try to race any Mustangs  But overall it has the pick up I need for my driving style  Now onto the 4x4 option  Being in Michigan  we splurged for the 4x4 LS version  Never having a 4x4 before  I had NO idea what to expect  Most of this winter was snowless  so I didn t utilize the 4x4 much  But it did come in handy when we did use it  Traveling back from the UP at Thanksgiving  we drove into a near white out  My husband flipped the TB  as we call it  into AWD and took off  no slipping  no sliding  To test it we flipped off the 4x4 and definetly saw the difference The LS version of the Trailblazer comes with some nice features  The CD radio is decent  With no speakers in the rear storage area  you can t get the car  bumpin  but it fits our needs 99  of the time  I LOVE the dual climate control  My husband can bust into a sweat when it s 10 degrees outside  where as I can have goose bumps when it s 70  So having the ability to control our own heat ac is nice  3 cup holders in the front  is a feature I love  Having only one cup holder in the 99  Grand Am  makes you really apperciate 3   The 2 cigarette lighters  well one lighter  one port  make it convient to be charging a cell phone and running a radar detector  The large map pockets on the door are handy for storing CD s  maps  papers  books  etc  The middle console  or hoofer as we call it  is nice and deep for lots of storage  It also has grooves for holding CD s if you prefer The middle row of seats have their own features too  There are an additional 2 cup holders that flip down onto the  hump  The middle seats also have their own climate control panel and cigarette  port  The middle row seats flip in a 40 60 split making it convient to haul boxes  skis  bookcases  10  trees  etc  done all of them  There is also a small amount of storage available under the seats The rear cargo area is nice and roomie  It features a  hidden  storage compartment  There are also to side storage compartments  The rear cargo area also has the 4th cigarette  port  The back hatch has strap to add in pulling it down  from inside or out  The back hatch also has the option of just opening the rear window  The back window also has a rear wiper  One thing my LS did NOT come with but we added on later is remote keyless entry  I STRONGLY suggest you get that option  The rear hatch can only UNLOCK by key  To lock the hatch you have to use the car s main locks  VERY ANNOYING Here I sit  one year and 30 000 miles later and I m still as in love with my TB  Like I said  I was pricing mini SUV s at the time  so getting something like the TB  with as much as it offers was a great surprise  After the GM discount  thanks Uncle Tim and Mom  and the  2500 in rebates  we drove off the lot with a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer LS 4x4 for the same price as a Ford Escape 4x2  
Camera, I have been posting images to the Internet for a couple of year now and it was always the same old routine  buy film  take the pictures  and hope for the best  have the film processed  scan the acceptable shots into the computer and then upload them to the web  To me it didn t seem like the best way to handle the steps  So I started looking at digital cameras My main objective was to find a decent camera at a very reasonable price   my choice the Kodak DC200 Plus The DC200Plus comes with the following features Megapixel picture resolution   1152 by 864 pixels Point and shoot Auto exposure Focal range from 27 inches to infinity 4 megs of memory on the card provided Serial connection to your computer Uses 4AA batteries Tripod mount Video out connection for hook up to TV or VCR Self Timer I know this may sound a little overwhelming if you have never used a digital camera before   but it s a great little camera  I took over 400 picture in a three month period and I have found it very useful for Internet imaging The thing that I find most useful is the instant access to the picture  If I take a picture  I look at the preview   If I like it  I keep it  if I don t I delete it and try again  This way the only images I store in the camera are the one s that I plan to use   It beats processing a 36 exposure roll and only being able to use four or five One thing that I do is that I still keep my 35mm handy   if I take a picture with the digital camera and it looks good on the preview   I take out the 35mm and commit an image to film  This way if I take something that I eventually want to have enlarged I will have a higher quality negative to work with The images produced by the camera are also printable   but I would not recommend enlarging them to anything larger than a 5 by 7  But they are very functional for the Internet The transfer to the PC is very acceptable and the software that comes with the camera does a very good job printing the images I have updated the firmware in the camera once since I purchased it  It was very easy   download the software   connect the camera   run the software   Boom  it s done What it lacks The camera is a battery hog  Buy rechargeable batteries and a charger The memory card should have been larger   if you use the standard resolution  the camera will hold about 35 images  In the highest setting the camera will only hold about 9 Kodak should have included an AC adapter with the camera The view hole  if you call it that  doesn t line up with the lens of the camera  This takes a little getting used to  but it should not stop you from purchasing the camera Overall   A good camera for the beginning digital user  The cost is right and the camera is very user friendly To see sample images check out http web dbtech net jp532 br br  
Camera, I was searching for a digital camera that I could afford  I never expected that I could get one of this caliber  The dc215 zoom millenium edition takes big 1152x864 res  great quality pictures  It comes with more memory than most cards offer  8mb which can fit 26 of the highest quality and highest resolution pictures possible  and it even includes the memory card reader so you don t have to transfer your pictures slowly through the included cable  It has 2x optical zoom  which means you can zoom 2x without losing any quality as in digital zoom  The millenium edition also comes with a cord to hook up the camera to your TV to view the pictures on a big screen  Other digital cameras that I looked at with most of these features were  400  The only things bad about this camera is that there is a kind of a long delay between shots and the batteries are usually used before your second fill of shots  but this can be remedied by buying the ac adapter and or rechargeable batteries br br  
Auto,  Introduction  I m rating my friends 1990 454SS This is an amazing truck  My friend bought it a few months ago and it was fast then  Since then  he s put about  3 000 in engine mods into it and its incredibly fast now b Pro s  It is a Chevy  so it has an excellent maintenance record  He s had to change the oil a few times and replace the distributor  Other than that  he has done thing but cosmetic and performance mods to it  If you need to do anything under the hood  there is plenty of space  even with the 7 4 liter engine It is really comfortable for two people  giving lots of leg and arm room  The seats are entitled   quot Sport quot  and they hold the occupant well  They don t look like they wrap around a lot  but they definitely hold you in your place  It originally came with a center console  but the previous owner got rid of it  He has since added a center pad  and even with three people  there is lots of room  although not too safe  since he didn t add a seat belt Throttle response is amazing  easily spinning the tires below twenty miles an hour  It came with a shift kit  so the shifts are aggressive and will squeal the tires in second gear It is faster than 90  of cars out there  faster than all but the Mustang Cobra GT in the Ford line up of today  and much faster than Lightening s of its period  It has a heavy duty drive train to stand up under 450 ft  lbs  of torque or more This truck turns better than any full size Chevy I ve ever seen  I don t know if it is part of the sport setup or just a good year for Chevy steering  but you can do a U tun in less than two lanes Part of this sport package is the size of the brakes  This truck will stop on a dime  stopping is much better than I ve seen in other trucks that weigh the same amount  Even some smaller cars trucks don t stop as well Chevy rigged up a line lock for the owner  Press the gas and brake at the same time and watch the tires light up in smoke b Neutral  This truck was only offered with a three speed automatic transmission  This limits top speed to 114 governed so the engine doesn t blow up  The three speed is the TH400E  which by car fanatics terms means it is very strong and hard to damage  One of the only ones that will handle all of the trucks torque This truck only comes in single cab short bed  No problem  especially if you just use it for racing  If you need to move more than one friend around it can get cumbersome Turning a truck will never be as fun as turning a car  The top heavy 454SS is not a road course truck by any means  For around  500 you can lower it and greatly improve your turning odds This truck does not come with four wheel drive  After all  why should it  You don t need a truck that is this fast off road I love the seats  my friend says he thinks they make is back sore  May be the lack of lumbar  Add a pillow to fix this b Cons  It gets terrible gas mileage  The racing transmission has only three gears  which drops the gas mileage to 11 3 on the highway  and the top speed just shy of 115 miles per hour Chevy paint never holds up very long  it was chipping very badly before he got it painted  It developed a gentle oil leak before we changed the oil  but it is gone now Its 450 some odd lbs  of torque make it easy to spin the tires  no matter what the pavement is like  which wears the tires quickly Insurance is very high  especially for a sixteen year old average student b Variations  The 1990 454SS only comes in black  It is a very attractive black and the truck looks great  The 1990 also comes with the TH400E transmission In 1991 1993 the truck was offered in black  white and red  It had a 4L80E  which is a four speed computer controlled TH400E  but with a different gearing in the differential  the 1991 93 trucks get the same gas mileage You may see trucks that sport   quot 350 SS quot  they are not real trucks  Chevy did not make them  Some are just stickers  while others have real performance modifications like blowers and Nitrous b Overall  If you want a truck that is incredibly fast  aggressive and fun  this is the truck for you  But  don t expect to just pay the sticker price  expect at least  50 a month in gas  and at least  100 a month in insurance  Of course  to get it really moving  you ll need some headers and other modifications  but even stock it is a really fast truck If you need a truck to tow extremely heavy things  the 454SS will do it without even groaning  You ll have a hard time damaging the drive train by over torquing or overworking the transmission Don t expect to take it off road  and expect anyone in a slightly sporty car to want to race br br  
Auto, The Mitsubishi Montero is an affordable SUV with plenty of room and a dream to drive  I purchased a 2000 Montero in December and fell in love with it right from the start  All in all the total package of the Montero is suprising for its cost  The model that I purchased  the LS  has alot of bells and whistles on it for its price  It came standard with power locks  power windows  privacy windows  tinted windows  CD player  and lots of storage compartments just to name a few  As far as driving goes  it glides along the road like a dream  sometimes making you forget just how fast that you are going  The powerful V 6 engine gives you alot of get up and go  which should interest even those picky people that dont want to part with there sports cars and get into something  quot bigger quot  The stearing is power assisted which makes it alot easier to turn  and the blind spots are almost non existant due to big side view mirrors and plenty of glass all the way around  I feel that anyone that is looking into getting something a little bit bigger should look into the Mitsubishi Montero before anything else  With this vehicle  you get alot for your money  and then some br br  
Auto, I got my 1995 Chevy Prizm  formerly known as the Geo Prizm  towards the end of 1996  I chose the car after exhaustive research amongst cars in its category  specifically looking for reliability  I know nothing about cars and engines  so naturally I was looking for something trouble free and value  Based on experience  I m personally skewed towards Japanese imports  Toyota or Honda and the likes  Because I wasn t willing to pay much money for any car  I settled for the best value available  the Prizm  which has Chevy body  American built body  and Toyota Corolla engine Having had the car for more than 3 years  I cannot give out enough praises for it  It has been very very reliable  knock on wood  The only shop visits I made was to the Jiffy Lube guys to change the oil and do other standard maintenance  Boy  this car has endured so much with me  come to think of it  It s coming with me rain or shine  It doesn t mind to my swears and yells  I got the real basic Prizm  the one with 1 6 liter engine and nothing else  literally  No automatic this or that  I adore 5 speed manual transmission  and I don t mind cranking the handle to open the window  So what I got was perfect for me  I have to admit that the seats could have been a little fluffier  I only feel this when doing long distance driving  above 5 hours  The power and handling are also marginal  but good enough for my purposes  The interior is decently roomy for me  Probably because of my smallish frame  The outer body wasn t made of the strongest steel available  But I wasn t looking for tank either All said  I think this is a car for someone like me  a person with no knowledge about engines  other than basic maintenance  doesn t want to spend too much on a car  but wants a reliable vehicle to bring him from point A to point B  This is definitely not for those who are looking for status symbol or a muscle car Everything considered  I am a happy camper with my Prizm  I still have it and probably will stick with it for a couple more years     
Camera, The ephoto 780c is probably one of your best values in the megapixle camera market  Good quality pictures for average use  i e  internet  etc  I have made a lot of money with the ability to show a good picture on the auction services  thanks to this little gem  Easy to use  good ergonomic feel  and great software  Now for the bad points  Aside from the terrible battery life  the distracting green light in the viewfinder and the relatively large distance between viewfinder and lens  my camera had an unusual problem  The shutter release button lost it s  quot click quot  Sounds odd  I know  But it is a very important feature of ANY camera to have a good mechanical support system for all of the function buttons  or you risk the possibility of premature feature activation  in this case  premature shutter release  I called Agfa support  and after an eternity on hold  the girl was very nice  She walked me through test procedures and determined that the camera did in fact work and that she could not help me  even though the camera is still in the warranty period  I bought the unit on 2 7 2000  it is now 11 22 2000  I asked for the service or parts department to see if I could resolve this matter myself  Her answer shocked me   quot We do not offer repair or parts services sir quot  What this means is if your camera breaks after the warranty period  throw it away and buy another one  Even if it is in the warranty period  if it develops a problem that does not directly affect the ability of the unit to take a picture  i e  prevents picture from being taken or downloaded to the computer  you re out of luck  This is like saying if the spring on the trigger of your handgun is broken and you shoot yourself in the foot every time you take the piece out of the holster  there is nothing the manufacturer will do for you because after all  the gun does fire bullets  In all fairness though  Agfa did agree to replace my camera after a lot of complaining  But let s face it the camera WAS BROKEN  If Agfa can work out all of the bugs in this unit  they could have one of the most popular cameras on the market today  I love the unit  I just think company support could be better br br  
Camera, First off  I know precious little about photography  If you re looking to read about specs and the nuances of digital photography  read the reviews from people who know what they re talking about  All I know is that this camera is durable  easy to use and results in beautiful color prints  So if you  like me  just want to pick up a little camera and be able to successfully operate it  then the Powershot S230 is probably a wise choice The size is perfect  Small enough to fit into a purse or pant pocket  I ve hauled this camera across country and barely known it s there  The battery life is decent  With pretty regular use I seldom need to recharge it  When it does need juicing up  the charge doesn t take but an hour or so  Without using the manual I was able to figure out the general controls  battery port location and remove replace the memory card  So this may be a bad sign for someone who is looking for a camera loaded with features  It does have an  outdoor  setting and red eye reduction  among other features  but basically I just turn it on  point and shoot  There is a small button on the back of the camera to select  movie  mode  the playback screen or adjust the setting to take regular pictures  I rarely use the movie mode  as I d prefer to use my old time y video movie camera for that sort of thing  but it I have used it and the picture is decent  I had a hard time adjusting to using it for the movie setting  as the camera is so tiny and it just felt strange for me to film that way after being used to lugging around a five pound VHS home movie camera  I prefer using it as a straight digital camera  It is very simple to erase a picture you don t want  even though you won t be erasing much as just about every photo captured is worth saving  When I grow more confident with my skill  I plan to pursue the other settings this camera has to offer  I do know that in the hands of a person FAR from being an expert  I was able to capture the moment and not miss a shot  On a recent trip to the Oregon coast  I was tickled pink to see that the Canon perfectly captured the turquoise of the water without missing a beat  Little old me was actually able to take those  postcard  shots and have some bragging rights when I got home  Removing the memory card is super simple and it s a one step process to attach to my Mac  Downloading was a snap and I didn t have to buy any extra software to view the photos on my desktop I realize this review isn t too helpful to people looking for thorough information  but if you just want to start with an affordable  yet quality camera I can t see the Canon letting you down  In the hands of this idiot it did just what it SHOULD do  It worked  Beautifully  
Camera, If you are looking for a 3  megapixel camera  which is what experts seem to be recommending as the minimum for truly film quality images  then strongly consider this model or the Kodak DX3700  which are the cheapest in this megapixel class  The DX3700 has fewer bells and whistles and cheaper by about  100  so I agonized over paying extra for the DX3900  but I m extremely happy with it nonetheless  The autofocus is the best I ve had on any point and shoot camera  extremely accurate under all light conditions weather your standing in the moon light or under a bright sun  I find there are few wasted shots  even with the luxury of being able to delete the bad ones  There seem to be only two meaningful differences between the cameras   1  the DX3700 zoom is only digital  i e  electronic  but the DX3900 zoom is both digital and  optical  so the physical lens also has a zoom  which seems to be more accurate and reliable in quality than digital zoom  and  2  the DX3700 has 8MB internal storage plus buy your own removable Smart Media cards  which apparently are favored in Japan Europe  while DX3900 has no internal MB and buy your own removable CompactFlash cards  which are used more in USA  but price per megabyte  MB  storage is virtually the same  approx   1 MB  for either medium  Clearly  if you have a limited budget  the DX3700 is the best bang for your buck since it produces the same quality of pictures  but with next cheapest camera in the 3  megapixel class currently around  500  even the DX3900 remains a good deal if you want a better zoom and or this particular storage medium   In practice  I have found that the combination of the digital and optical zoom  total 6x  allows for greater flexibility in picture taking and I suspect the digital zoom alone on the DX3700  only 3x  would have been less useful  if you take personal photos for posterity this affects photo quality as much as the number of pixels and should be an important consideration  Other pluses  the DX3900 is extremely lightweight  but not flimsy  which had worried me  with memories of the old Brownie cameras  indeed  it s small enough to carry in my shirt pocket  It s also a sleek  good looking camera  with a lens that automatically retracts into a covered door to protect the lens when you turn the camera power on and off  a useful feature for the careless like me  Don t bother with the proprietary docking station  which is just a plastic tray for  70  The docking station is supposed to be one touch no brainer transfer of photos to your computer  but it takes just as much work to figure out the tray as to simply connect the camera to your computer with a wire  The storage of pictures on the 8meg card that comes with the camera  It holds 7 pics at 3 1 megapixels  15 at 3 1 high compressed  10 at 2 2 megapixels  13 pics at 1 6 megapixels  and 23 at  8 megapixel shots  I plan on purchasing the Viking CF128Meg card  as this is the best buy for the compact flash that I have seen  They could have made this camera at least 2  larger and the LCD viewer is also small  Downloading 25 50 pictures seemed to take a minute or less to my computer  which I think is relatively miraculous  The Kodak software you use to view and manipulate the pictures is easy to use  Kodak is the Disney or MacDonalds of the photo world and I think even my mom could figure it out  Best feature is the one that lets you save in different formats for e mailing  a real time saver when you want to share photos with others electronically  Also don t let anyone tell you that you need to replace the Kodak paired batteries that come with the camera with Kodak ones  you can use other brands of AA batteries  although the manual says they need to be 1 2 volt  i e  rechargeable variety  and not the standard 1 5 volt  non rechargeable  kind  there s little reason not to be rechargeable anyway  which are more cost effective  In a few years  you ll no doubt be able to buy 4 or 5 megapixel cameras for the same price  but from what I ve read  beyond 3 megapixels  you can t really tell the difference except at huge enlargment sizes  i e  bigger than 8x11  and most snapshots are only 4x6 or maybe 5x7  so what would be the point  So  in sum  this is a very good camera value if you don t want to let once in a lifetime moments slip away while you wait for prices on film quality 3 megapixel camera prices to drop  yet you don t want to spend what Canon  Nikon and others are charging  500  
Auto, If you put on tons of miles  but want to look good doing it  this the car for you  I am a Mother of one and I have been driving my 1996 Mazda 626 for a year  It s sporty  affordable  and sensible  It s a great purchase for the average income family  Our family could not afford 2 expensive vehicles so we gave up our 1998 Grand Voyager for this car  I have never regretted it yet  I feel safe being in a sedan vehicle and not a compact car  Our family budget could not afford a Camry  The Mazda s back seat is spacious  The handle of this vehicle is wonderful  I live in the midwest  icy roads are common and the car does well on all types of roads  The Mazda 626 has saved me and my family hundreds of dollars on gasoline  The mileage of this vehicle ranges from 30 to 37 miles per gallon  I can guarantee I will drive this vehicle into the ground  I will get sick of it before it will quit history says so The Mazda 626 looks slick in black and I feel like a racing ma in it     
Auto, I have always owned cars until we bought a 99 GMC Sierra in August  I was VERY skeptical and didn t want it  We were moving to a rural area  we re in Alaska  and I was going to be driving 100 miles ONE WAY three days a week so my husband wanted me in something  quot big quot  This truck drives like a car with all the truck pluses  It s like driving a really BIG  TOUGH car  The push button AUTO 4 wheel drive is WONDERFUL  Alaskan roads can be slippery in parts and fine in others  Auto 4 wheel drive can handle it all  The extended cab is roomy in the back seat as well as the front  comfortably fitting 4 adults  The fold down console arm rest storage area is my favorite part  It is big enough to hold a NUMBER of CD s  a cell phone  and various other  quot necessities quot  It makes driving the truck more comfortable with a place to rest your right arm  as well as easily folding up to make room for another passenger  The easy fold up and down rear seat is also user friendly  I can easily move the seat myself  without assistance from anyone  The only thing I would suggest they do different is put the third door on the drivers side  it would be SO much more convenient there  Maybe I m lazy  but I hate having to walk all the way around to the other side  Oh  My other  big thing  about this truck I love is the keyless entry  It is SO nice to just push a button to unlock the door or relock them  especially if your hands are full  It is also nearly impossible to lock yourself out of this truck when it s running  You have to PHYSICALLY put the key in the door to lock it  One other thing I would change the cup holders  make them more sturdy  they tend to bounce too much and then your drink gets splashed all over the radio heater controls  I would recommend this truck to anyone  single guy  married family  It is easy to get in and out of  it has room  it s reliable  and it s great to drive     
Camera, We have had our Sony Mavica for a year and a half  I have used a number of digital cameras and we tried out even more in the shops in Tokyo before we bought it The best feature has to be the disk drive   no need to worry about running out of some expensive little memory stick   just buy a new box of disks  In fact we did run out of disks on our trip to the Grand Canyon but we figured we weren t far from somebody with a PC  We managed to persuade the Helicopter operator company to sell us a box of disks Get home and immediately stick the disk in and upload view the images  The camera creates a simple HTML file as an index to the images so it s easy to flick through them At a friends house  No worries   they re bound to have a PC and of course it s got a floppy drive  No problem showing your last few days of pics to them I have a friend back in the UK that actually takes his PC on his ski trips with him  just  so that he can download pictures from his digital camera  No need with the Mavica Another great feature is the big screen on the back of the camera  It continuously updates when you are framing a shot  This doesn t sound like much but it is so much easier to use than certain other cameras which only update every second or so  I m convinced that the screen display is the reason that our four year old can take perfect pictures with this camera  It also means that you don t have to have one eye on the scene and another on the screen The image quality is superb in good light  We have found it doesn t take the best night shots   there is a powerful flash but it can be a little overpowering sometimes If you are an SLR buff moving to digital  you would definitely want to move up the Mavica range from the FD81  However for any vacation family shots or taking pics for display on the web  selling on eBay etc  I d recommend the FD81 The battery life is very good  Better still  it always tells you how many minutes you ve got left  On vacation  it usually lasts us a few days taking photos and movies every day br br  
Auto, As a staunch opponent of the  quot I m just a suburbanite but I need a SUV that I ll never really use quot  craze I didn t expect too much out my family s new lease S10 pickup  It s a droopy looking pickup and the color is the same as on innumerable plain looking Camrys and Accords  Inside is lots of grey plastic  although the visibility is excellent  And with a 4 cylinder  manual  extended cab P U  how much fun can possibly have with it  The answer  more than you might think  You see  this truck doesn t make much power  Only about 120 horses  give or take  But what is there the manual will let you hold on to desperately  Add the benefits of having  a stick shift  rear wheel drive  skinny  grip deficient tires  and no weight over the rear end and what you have  my friend  is one truck that manages to have fun  This thing is so easy to powerslide it s not even funny  Just hang the tail out a tad  add a little opposite lock  and then you ll be all straightened out  In addition its unassuming looks and unexciting color make for one hell of a stealth vehicle  But wait  there s more  Hauling utility is excellent  By my count I fit 40 bags of mulch  14 2x4s  and one leaf blower in with room to spare  This is in addition to the fairly generous extended cab  which can hold at least 2 large golf bags  Don t be fooled into thinking that little jumpseat will hold anything larger than a large rodent  though  Only a few drawbacks  Wheezy engine  sounds like a broken coffee grinder  not a great handler and or braker  and the rides a tad rough  However after considering that the S10 is as cheap as it is I guess there s no room to complain  really  I mean  11 000  That s dirt cheap br br  
Auto, After driving all the mini vans on the market  reading all the articles  surfing the net for user comments  like here  and talking to real Kia mechanics  I bought the Kia Sedona EX  all options for  21 500  The dealer even threw in 3 years of oil changes I only have a couple hundred miles on the van  but everything is perfect  no rattles  no squeaks  no problems  It drives great and is very quiet on the road   I will report any problems in the future  As a service to those who are in the market for a minivan  I offer the following to consider 1  There is really no question about the value of the Sedona when comparing it to the other minivans  You would have to pay  7 000 to  10 000 extra to get a comparable mini van from Honda  Toyota  Dodge    2  The only real question mark concerns the quality and reliability of the Sedona  To address this issue  Kia offers the best warranty on the market  To put my mind at ease  I also talked to 3 different mechanics  from 3 different dealers  and they all said the same thing The Sedona is the first vehicle Kia has produced that meets the Japanese in terms of initial quality and reliability   The Kia cars are getting better  but still have room for improvement  In addition  none of the mechanics saw any consistent repair problems   yet  Two of the mechanics thought that if there would be a problem it could be in the area of brakes  The fact the Sedona weighs 500 800 pounds more than other mini vans may require more frequent replacement of the brake pads  The other mechanic thought that the Kia engineers would have designed  beefier  brakes to accommodate the extra weight  I guess only time will tell FYI   For those of you who may be wondering about the Honda Odyssey  magic  third row seats that fold into the floor consider this  Your only option with the third row of seats is  all or none  What does this mean in the real world  Well  my neighbor has an Odyssey and we were going to travel with 5 people and lots luggage  which required the removal of seats to accommodate the luggage  The problem with the Odyssey  magic seat  is if you make them disappear  so does seating for 3 people  So you are left with lots of room for luggage  but seating for only 4 people   Of course you could remove 1 of the middle row chairs for luggage storage  but this is inconvenient placement of the luggage and 2 people have to sit in the less comfortable third row of seats  With my Sedona  I just removed one of the third row seats and we were ready to go A comfortable chair for each of the 5 adults and room for the luggage in the back  where it belongs  If Kia were smart  they would introduce a split  magic  seat on their next van  
Camera, There s no question about it  This camera will be a little bit of an investment  However  we re not photographers  and we re pleased as punch with this camera  Picture quality is far superior to my 35 mm  and the ease with which you can transfer pictures to the computer makes this a great choice  The only drawback is that  because it s so expensive  we don t want to take it along on trips where it might get stolen or broken I ve taken pictures in the dark before  just hoping I was aiming in the right direction  and the pictures turned out great  The zoom is wonderful  we ve taken pictures about an acre away  and the subject looks like it s right in front of the camera   with no degradation  Memory capacity is wonderful   just get a memory card with the capacity that you need  The flash works great in any light  Battery life is acceptable  we just buy rechargeable batteries so that we can have spares on hand The only problem that we ve encountered is when we first got the camera  We took a bunch of pictures  deleted some that we didn t want  and then took some more  Later  when we transferred the pictures to the computer  we discovered that the later pictures  though they existed on the camera  couldn t be seen by the computer  Customer support was nonexistent  they didn t even call us back  but we discovered that it was because we didn t reinitialize the memory card before taking pictures  Now  whenever we delete any pictures  we reinitialize the memory card before doing anything else  This means that we need to transfer the existing photos onto the computer first  so if you re going to be taking a lot of pictures at one time  it would be best to have a lot of memory cards on hand  But since we discovered this  we haven t had any problems  
Camera, After writing a review of the Minilux  this is my second one  I sold my Minilux last summer to buy a Contax G2  probably will be my next review  I wanted to go digital for a couple of years and found the quality so so and prices fairly high  Anyhow  I bought this Leica 4 3 before Christmas and I carry it everywhere  Small  easy to use and it takes great pictures  It s fun to use and you download the pictures in your computer It s a different way to photograph  kind of polaroid on steroids  you can do an 80sec of video  which is kind of fun  I bought the Leica  I should say Fuji revised  because it s a Fuji with Leica dressing it up and for those who know Leica  when they dress up they are pretty good at it At maximum definition  you get 18 pictures with the card and probably zillions at a low definition  what s the use if definition is lousy  You can get cards with more memory but if you have a computer  you just have to download them and start again  It takes 2 batteries AA rechargable It doesn t replace 35mm for me because I like B   W and I like to have prints of 16 X 20 or 11 X 14  Optics are OK  but it s not so great for shooting architecture  To me it adds up to your regular photo equipment  I compared the Fuji to the Leica  the finish of the Fuji is not as nice  less memory  cheaper software but about 300  less  Being a digital camera  it s not an investment in the sense of the regular M6 or all the other M s  In a year or so  a new one will come on the market with 6 or 8 million pixels and my toy will be obsolete  But for the time being  it s a pretty cool camera with lots of features that I probably will never use  time will tell What I like of this company  I don t work for them or even in that business is that they come up with really cool tools  on one end you ll get the O leica which takes you back to the 1920s and you have digital  It seems that 30  of the company is now owned by Hermes  luxury brand  I hope that they won t play too much with the lineup  Ostrich elephant skin gold stopwatch cdplayer goes with your shoes point and shoot camera Cool camera  nice design  easy to use  expensive but they have a really nice logo  
Auto, The Jeep Cherokee is by far the crapiest SUV that I have ever driven  Ass soon as I bought it I hit a pot hole going down a crappy road and the air conditioning failed to work  SUV my ass  When I tried to drive through a small feild I hit a tractor divot and got stuck  This is by far the bumpiest SUV that I have driven  Even if I ran over a small speed bump  even with my seat belt on  I would end up hitting my head on the top of the Jeep  It also is one of the loudest cars I have ever heard  at 75mph I thought that the thing was going to blow up and the wheels were going to fly off  The thing that kills me the most is that it cost me  18 000  After about 2 weeks I decided I couldn t take it any more and traded it in for a used  99 ford F250  by far the best truck I have ever had br br  
Camera, OVERALL I like the camera  but 2 annoyances really keep me from giving the camera 4 stars  In fact  they are so severe that they bump it down to the 1 or 2 star range  I bought the camera for its MPEG VX 640x480 movie mode  so more on that later I ll guess that most of the readers here will know the basic spec s and features of the DSC P8  so I ll focus on some things that might not be so well known THE MOST AGGRAVATING FEATURE The macro button alone is responsible for more wasted shots than any other flaw in a camera of mine  I count this as the third generation of the CyberShot P series  and the last two have have the same bewildering placement of the macro button  It is too close to where you would naturally place your thumb  What s worse is the fact that the macro button is rather prominent and just far too easy to inadvertently activate  it was a problem on the DSC P7   P9 and Sony has just made it WORSE by making the button even taller than it was before on the P8   P10   P12 This is just so STUPID  There can t be that many people using macro mode to justify making this THE MOST LIKELY button to get activated on the camera  yes  it s even easier to hit than the shutter release button EXPOSURE It s a point and shoot camera and it should do snapshots well  but it just doesn t  Like the DSC P7 that I previously owned  this camera seems to get the exposure wrong more than I like  Too often  the camera overexposes the subject s face into an unrecognizable white blob  Other times  it flat out guesses in the opposite direction by leaving the subject completely dark  I ve tried both spot and matrix metering to no avail What is disappointing about all this is that my old DSC P1 seemed to get exposure right more often  My recommendation is to shoot lots of pic s and bracket as much as possible  Unlike the DSC 10  the P8 does not auto bracket so you have to do this manually MOVIES In early 2003  only a rare few digital cameras had unlimited movie  with sound  recording modes  Sony s on the other hand have been offering this feature for over a year now  Now that it is mid 2003  more cameras are emerging with unlimited recording time  limited of course only by the memory card size  With this feature becoming more commonplace  there are fewer reasons to buy a Sony Here s the skinny on the new MPEG VX 640 x 480 movie recording mode  It doesn t look any better than 320x240 movies The MPEG VX mode is an interpolated MPEG HQX 320x240  And trust me I have tried and tried and tried to look for any difference between the VX and HQX  320x240  or even HQ  also 320x240  movies  There just simply isn t any discernable difference  I ve even done back to back comparisons between the three  using a DSC P1 and DSC P9  and I have yet to find any difference The most compelling evidence of interpolation is that the recording times for a 128MB memory stick are identical for MPEG HQX and MPEG VX I DISLIKE THE MEMORY STICK  Geeeez  Who likes to pay two to four times as much as everybody else is paying for the same size memory  Let s see  after rebates 256MB MemoryStick    50 256MB CompactFlash    28 1GB MemoryStick    480  YIKES 1GB CompactFlash    160 I DISLIKE THE WRIST STRAP Sony really cheaped out on this  Previous DSC P1 P7 P9 had a nice wrist strap with a sliding collar that secured the camera to your wrist  The P8 has a flimsy strap that is missing the collar  There s no secure way to carry the camera now  I just don t understand why this would be missing SOME THINGS THAT I DO LIKE it s small it s tough burst 2 mode is especially nice for capturing shots of kids  kids never sit still  
Camera, I recently purchased the Sony Mavica 83  I was torn between the Kodak and the Sony  I used my friend s Kodak for a few days and tried to download the pictures onto my PC and was having a great deal of difficulty  I then asked my friend to print them out on his computer  Well  after watching him try to get these pictures out of this camera  with very little ease  I made up my mind immediately on the Sony  I consider myself extremely computer literate and I was very frustrated with the Kodak  My office had purchased a Sony and I tried it out  The difference was amazing  With the Sony  all you do it put a floppy in the camera  take it out  and put it in any PC that s available   that s it I ve tried several other digital cameras that friends of mine have  The Sony is by far the most convenient and easiest to use  The pictures are of top quality and you can use anybody s PC to view them  There are no wires  adapters  extra software  etc  to worry about  People who are not so computer literate will find this camera extremely user friendly I purchased the Epson Stylus printer to print out the pictures  That too is great br br  
Camera, I highly recommend this digital camera  The main reason I purchased the Olympus D 340  was for taking pictures for the auctions I put on Ebay  I do not print my pictures  I use them on the net  I did not want to spend a lot of cash  For  300 I believe I got a really high quality camera  The 1 8 quot  LCD screen has proven to be very accurate  There is a 2x zoom macro on this camera   very useful for showing the detail on auction items  The included Adobe software is an added bonus  This camera does include the cable to download the pictures onto the computer  If I had to choose a bad feature on this camera  it would be download speed  There are accessories available to speed up this process however br br  
Auto, The Volvo S70 is a great car with too many great features to even compare them to the small amount of bad things The good stuff a larger interior than one expects very comfortable seats without being to soft very comprehensive driver controls  unlike the Mercedes where I hear there are more than ten controls just for the drivers seat solid construction and feel which is sportier than the old Volvos  240 sharp lines reminiscent of older models  which I really like  without being to boxy simple design which is carried forward in the driving experience a crisp and close to the road driving experience very responsive and aggressive extremely safe The bad stuff the trunk doesn t always open with the remote the seat memory feature which is supposed to adjust the seat depending on what key is put in  so each driver doesn t have to change it doesn t always work the controls for the passenger seat are kind of annoying to use it can be hard to turn the key  multiple attempts sometimes necessary OVERALL a very exciting family car    
Camera, I bought this camera just two days ago because I am going on vacation in two weeks and I needed a good  compact  light weight  with good picture quality  and not too expensive digital camera  thats how I stumbled upon this Olympus Camedia C 4000 Zoom Digital Camera  Now I have only used it for two days and I am already begining to fall in love with it  But just for new buyers  buy 128MB smartmedia memory card s  with your camera because they only include a 16MB one  only takes about 24 shots  Features    USB Connection SmartMedia Memory Card Compatible 4 1 Mega Pixel Resolution 3X Optical Zoom 10X Digital Zoom Video Out PC and MAC Compatible Optical Viewfinder and LCD Display QuickTime Movie Recording 4 x AA Battery or 2 x CR V3 Lithium Battery Packs JPEG and TIFF Picture Formats Picture Quality    The picture quality is very sharp and clear  You will definitely not be disappointed with the print quality if you have a good printer  Resolutions include  3200x2400  2288x1712  2048x1536  1600x1200  and 1280x960  Video Quality    Although there is no audio support  video resolutions are available in QuickTime Motion JPEG format and the resolutions include  320x240  160x120  This camera takes the best video that I have seen among some of the Digital Camera  You won t be dissapointed by the results  Battery    This digital camera comes with two CR V3 lithium battery packs and can also be used with 4 AA batteries which allow for about 3 hours or 600 700 shots  The battery life is great if yo  u do not use the LCD monitor that much  but if you are like me and use the LCD a lot then battery life is of concern  There is no battery charger included so you might want to include this in your purchase also  Comfort and handling    This camera fits very nicely in your hands and seem to just be an extention to you arms  The buttons seem to be placed in comfortable locations so you won t get cramps in your fingers while taking a lot of pictures  Usage   updated  5 14 2003  After using this camera for two weeks  I am falling in love with it  The picture are turning out brilliantly and the camera is performing outstandingly  Even if I don t use the flash in a dark room  it automatically lights the picture  but sometimes its a little blurly without the flash  The video clips are good quality  With the starter 16MB SmartMedia card I can take about 16 picture that are high quality and about 32 picture with lower quality  The two CR V3 lithium battery packs lasted for over 330 pictures with and without flash  When reviewing the pictures the only thing that is unusual is the placement of the navigation arrow keys  It would be better if it was where your thumb is when you hold the camera  Conclusion    This is a great camera to invest your money into  it will be around for some time  It will allow you to share the greatest moments of your life with your loved ones  At the same time  if you want to take pictures for your business and your postings on ebay com  you will be able to do all of that and more  So good luck and enjoy  
Auto, I love the Humvee  my experience though is limited to the military version  Which is a heavier more rugged one  with bulletproof doors and windows  The Humvee is simply the best vehicle on the market if you decide you want to drive over  or through something  Completely water tight you can drive through a river and as long as the air stack is above the water line  you can breathe  it is like a big snorkel The humvee is as wide as it is tall  this was designed to prevent the roll overs that was the problem with the Army Jeep The Humvee can accept the standard m60 machine gun  a 50 cal machine gun  a 40mm automatic grenade launcher  or a missle launcher  It also has towing capabilities  in case you decide to tow a 135mm cannon behind you  You can never have enough things to blow stuff up with  Road Rage   just try to mess with the hummer The only two annoying things about the hummvee is the horrid acceleration times it has  and pathetic gas mileage Oh yeah  and cost almost 70 to 85 thousand for a truck the government pays under 30thousand each for  You get a CD player  the government gets missles  who gets the better deal  update  13 people who visited and didn t rate this I m going to have to find me a missle launcher  At least click on something  Don t just leave  if you thought this stunk  rate it so br br  
Auto, One of the most dramatic changes in the 2003 4Runner must be the highly evolved body contours  At last the 4Runner has moved beyond  trucklike  into a stylish multi purpose vehicle  My last car was a Mercedes ML 320 and through it I got to know every single technician in the dealers service department  Mainly because of NUMEROUS rattles and part failures which required continuous visits back and forth to service  I didn t want to go through that again  So I focused my attention on three well rated vehicles  the Honda Pilot  and the Toyota Highlander and 2003 4Runner  I test drove all three and really liked the Highlander and the Pilot  I initially felt the 4Runner had a bulky feel to it  But  after I drove the  Sport  model with the X REAS suspension my opinion changed  Honda dealers will not negotiate the price of the Pilot down by one penny and almost all options are extra  and they quickly add up  Also  the Pilot is not available with a sun roof  The Highlander drove superbly and felt like a quality sedan  The main drawback was it was a little on the tame side and had somewhat of a minivan feel to it After I drove the 2003 4Runner 6 cyl Sport I knew I had found my vehicle  Mercedes Benz would be lucky if they could come up with an suv that drives this well  The Sport suspension makes a big difference in handling  But that is just one component of a really nicely assembled package  The interior space is very well thought out  It is ergonomically comfortable and has the space earlier 4Runners lacked  The fit and finish is really excellent  The controls and interior components look sharp  The seats are manually adjusting  but it doesn t take long to find a comfortable position  Plus  there is a power lumbar adjustment The factory stereo is outstanding  This 4Runner came equipped with lighted vanity mirrors which some models don t seem to have So far I have only driven only a few hundred miles but already I have driven through blinding snow and rain as well as deep  freshly fallen snow  Watch out  this car will plow right through and not miss a beat  At all times it has felt secure  warm  and comfortable  Bad weather performance shines  I just wish I could have kept that new car clean appearance at least a few days before confronting the winter elements  The 6cyl  gas mileage has been decent  an important factor to consider with the price of gas rising daily  
Camera, Aiptek Pocket Cam 3mega I have tried out this camera on a sale or return basis and compared it with a cheap 0 3mp camera and the Fuji FinePix2800  I was considering it as a present In summary I would say that the Aiptek is far superior to the 0 3mp pocket cameras as they are only just useful for small pictures on web pages  The Finepix 2800 however has high quality pictures in still mode  excellent macro and close up features as well as a reasonably easy to use menu system  So this new camera was always going to be given a good run for its money By comparison the Aiptek has only a poor close up facility so don t try to take pictures of your prize flowers as single heads  Its closest view was about 45cm  When trying to photograph documents it just did not achieve the resolution to make an A4 or A5 document readable  The Fuji had no problem with anything down to the size of a large postage stamp  One problem with the Aiptek is the burn out when using the flash on fairly close range objects The Aiptek has three resolutions 1mp  2mp and 3mp  When shooting a 30x25cm picture that filled the frame the Aiptek produced only a mediocre quality picture even at 3mp  with or without the flash  The Fuji did an excellent job  despite working at only 1mp Long and middle range views in good light were fine The movie mode on the Aiptek produced a clearer image than the Fuji with a truer balance for artificial light  Although the Aiptek uses the faster compact flash cards to store images the need to use this camera in the 3mp mode means that it still takes several seconds to make the camera available to shoot  especially if using the flash as well The Aiptek menu system is very straightforward and should not take long to learn Power is supplied by 2 AA alkaline batteries that come with the camera The standard memory card is 16mb but I would always recommend at least 64mb The camera is quite a handy size and  being the size of many mobile phones  will fit into the pocket or handbag The zoom lens is only 3x  I soon missed the 6x optical zoom of my Fuji  Also the zoom mode was disabled while using the movie mode and there is no sound with picture  unlike the Finepix The viewfinder is like to old compact cameras   i e  it has the same problem with parallax  Whilst this makes it clearer than the Fuji s electronic version it does make it harder to frame the picture accurately The viewfinder on the back is only slightly smaller than that of the Fuji  It is large enough and bright enough to operate effectively in most lighting conditions  It is a little harder in very bright sun but that is common to many other viewing panels on other cameras Overall I will return my review model and go back to my good old Finepix 2800  This Aiptek is easy to use and a handy size but does not seem to be good value to me and the resolution is well below what I would have expected for 3mp  
Camera, With a family of 7 we spent a LOT of money on photo developing  I had been wanting a digital camera for quite some time but hadn t found a decent one in my price range since I would have to buy a good photo printer to go along with it This camera was quite an impulse buy  We were browsing through Walmart and I saw this camera for sale with a Kodak Personal Picture Maker from Lexmark in a package deal for  199  Now  I usually don t buy electronic equipment from Walmart because I view thier Electronics department as very sub standard   Instert plug for Best Buy here Upon getting home with our new toy  I immediately started snapping pictures  Set up was a breeze and this camera s features are wonderful  It is very easy to understand and use for the beginner  but has features that an avid photographer would admire I quickly found that without a memory card you don t get very far with this camera  I am able to store 6 pictures in the best setting on the internal 2mb memory of the camera  This cameras features include 3 flash settings  auto flash  full time flash and no flash  I almost always use no flash because the flash in this camera is EXTREMELY bright and washes out anything taken in just about any light  I actually took a picture of a friend in the pitch black of night with the flash on and it came out clear as day  I don t think it needs to be that bright Other features are  A 2x zoom setting  I never use this feature because it is only available in the  good  setting and I always take my pictures in  best  It has a preview screen on the back that you can set to on or off  and can also turn on the quickview feature that shows you your picture immediately after it is taken  If you use the preview feature be prepared with a LOT of batteries on hand This camera comes with software for uploading and editing pictures  Uploading pictures is very easy  although very time and battery consuming  For 6 pictures I allow at least 10 minutes for uploading The photo editing software is great  You can crop  enhance  make photo greeting cards  although they only include Christmas templates  and print multiple pictures on 1 sheet of paper  This camera takes amazingly clear and vivid pictures as long as you have fresh batteries  As the batteries age the capture time prolongs and you get some fuzziness and blurring If you do go ahead and buy this Camera you will need to buy a memory card  I find that an 8mb card is sufficient for normal use  A lens cover  and usb a memory card reader to speed up the uploading time and save on battery life This camera alone retails for  119 at Walmart  although I have seen it as high as  179  I recommend the package deal for maximum cost efficiency I plan to write a review on the printer seperately  
Auto, My friend owns this car and we drive to golf every week  The course is in the hills  Lake Chabot Golf Course  and the road is really curvy and windy  And through these trips I ve come up with my own opinions of the 1995 Saab 900 The first useful aspect of the 900 is the trunk space  The trunk can fit both our golf bags have lots of room leftover  There s also a fair amount of room in the back row of seats  The head room is ample  but the foot space is a little cramped  The front passenger seat is  very  roomy  with enough space to stretch your legs   But I always have to sit in the back  oh well Another thing I noticed was the acceleration  On freeway on ramps the 900 struggles a little to get up to speed  I would say it has moderate acceleration  sufficient but somewhat lacking Back to the curving roads  While turning on those  I noticed some body roll on the car  It has good handling  but I think the stabilizer bars should be a little stiffer  Some people prone to car sickness might feel a bit quesey while riding the the 900 But one very important thing to note is that my friend s 900 has been to the shop multiple times  He s even considered trying to declare it a lemon  So keep in mind that if you purchase the 1995 900 you might have to make multiple repairs and fix ups I think that the 1995 Saab 900 is a good car overall  It s one BIG problem is reliability  Over 2 visits to the shop per year is too much  So if buying a used 900  make sure it has a manufacturers used car warranty or something like that  just to be safe br br  
Camera, I bought this product to take photographs of items I was selling on eBay  It was the least expensive digital camera I could find at the time and from reading the box it seemed like the resolution would be fine for my purposes  but I have since learned that the quality is not nearly as good as you might think The store had one of the cameras set up for customers to try  but you can t actually see the photographs as they would appear on a computer  you can only test features and view the LCD display  and the pictures on the display lead you to believe that the pictures will be very high quality However when I got home and took some pictures with the camera I found out the quality wasn t nearly as good as I had expected  Certainly the quality was passable  and I have since discovered ways to make the pictures look better  for instance taking pictures outside without the flash  but the quality just didn t meet my expectations  so if you re looking for something with professional results  as for business use  you will definitely want to look at something else I also have a problem with the fact that it eats batteries like crazy and it DID NOT come with an adaptor to allow it to plug in to the wall  and you can NOT get an adaptor for the camera locally  It takes a special adaptor that you have to order from Vivitar and it is rather expensive Overall  this was a decent purchase for the money  though  and I would recommend this for someone looking for an inexpensive way to take pictures of family and friends for use as personal pictures br br  
Camera, I ve owned the Sony Cybershot F55 for about 10 months and I still love it  It has some drawbacks but it works very well  It has been extremely reliable  durable and produces high quality images  The MPEG movie feature is an added bonus but it is missing an optical zoom and USB support  This model is like the first in the Cybershot series and the new DSC Sxx cameras seem to address some of the problems with the F55 I originally got the F55 because it met all of my the requirements of producing high resolution  quality images as well as short  movie  clips so I didn t have to get a camcorder  although I ended up getting one later anyways  I intended the movie feature to be used to film the inside of homes for my mom s real estate business but I didn t find any software to edit the MPEGs so it s been mostly a novelty and I ve used it on trips before we got the camcorder b It s great because b b  High resolution quality photos  The camera can record images in 1600x1200 pixels resolution with its Carl Zeiss lens  The coloration has been okay but not always perfect   sometimes it s has more green and often there is not enough contrast so the image looks dim and faded  The images sometimes come out a little blurry but when scaled down it is not noticeable  I ve ordered 4x6 inch prints of the photos I ve taken and they have come out fine from Ofoto after making corrections through Photoshop   1600x1200 has to be cropped to fit a 4x6 print  Shutterfly and PhotoAccess prints had more contrast and green tinting which made the JPEG compression artifacts more noticeable in solid areas  Ofoto says 1600x1200 pixel images are okay for 8x10 inch prints Here is a gallery of photos I ve taken with the F55  http www zing com album id 4294236267 b  Rechargeable battery  The camera uses Sony s InfoLithium battery which is rechargeable and the camera comes with a recharger and an AC adaptor  I find recharging the battery gives it about an hour of use  at least according to the camera display  It uses less power when I put it on playback mode instead of record as well as turning the LCD backlight off  An hour of usage may not seem like a lot but a couple pictures here and a couple there ends up lasting the whole day for me and only when I m also taking pictures at night do I start running low on power b  LCD display  The  hybrid  LCD display supposedly uses sunlight to illuminate the screen and this means it makes no difference whether the back light is on or off  I can still see the display  but it s kind of washed out  and I can save battery power with the back light off b  Good size  It s not too bulky like the Mavica and it doesn t have a protruding lens like the F505  It fits really snug in this leather bag I got with the camera which I recommend to anyone who gets the camera  I m not sure where you can get it but it has a little pouch in the back perfect for holding extra memory sticks b  Records MPEG movies  It can record MPEG movies in 320x240  up to 15 seconds  or 120x116  up to 60 seconds  I use Microsoft Media Player to view the movie files but haven t found a software to edit the frames or strip out audio b  Macro mode  I like taking close up photographs of objects and the macro option on the camera lets me do that without having to switch to a macro lens  The only draw back is that it is easy to blur the image because of movement and hard to tell it is blurred from the LCD display  It also has a short field of focus so sometimes other things closer or further away from the camera will be out of focus b  Swivel lens  The lens rotates back 180 degrees and it s advertised as a way to take a picture or video of yourself while looking at the LCD  But seriously this flexibility is one of the best features of the camera  I use it to take pictures behind me of the sky or sunset when I am in a car  and I am not driving of course  If we are going the opposite direction or I am on the other side of the car  I can stick it out the window and rotate the lens so I see the view in the LCD  The lens on the newer F505 model swivels too but it seems not on the DSC Sxx series b What could be improved b b  Lack of optical zoom  There isn t an optical zoom  only a digital zoom on this camera  This has been acceptable for the most part because I don t find the need to zoom in very often  It s only when like I m trying to photograph animals that I wish there was a zoom  I would look into the other Cybershot models if you need zoom options b  PictureGear Lite software  The PictureGear software that comes with the camera is the  lite  version  It s pretty weak and the software basically only lets the user download the images from the camera using the serial connection  Use a photo editing software like Photo Deluxe or Photoshop if you want to manipulate the images  If you own a Sony VAIO you may have the complete PictureGear version which has more options and supposedly lets you stitch together images to create a panoramic b  Serial connection slow  lack of USB support  Using the serial connection to download photos from the camera to the computer takes a very long time  What s worse is that I can t really do anything else on the computer when it is downloading  On top of that the PictureGear software sometimes crashes  I ve given up using the serial method since I got a PCMCIA card  The card lets me access the memory stick on a laptop as if it was a regular drive  Then I hook up the laptop and my desktop computer on a network to get the files  There is a memory stick floppy adapter but I haven t tried it  Neither the PCMCIA card nor the floppy adaptor come with the camera  The F55 does not have USB support but the newer models do Some of the new Sony VAIOs have a memory stick slot on the side and that s one of the reasons I got a VAIO for my mom  When we ve gone on trips  I only need to take the camera and laptop  After shooting a day s worth of pictures  I move the files off of the camera to laptop b  Lack of non compressed file format  The camera only stores still images as JPEGs and does not have the option to save in a non compressed format such as TIFF  There are two options for the quality of the image   standard and fine  I always use the fine setting because I usually end up further processing the image through photo editing software like Photoshop and the final picture has to go through JPEG compression on top of the JPEG compression from the camera so I have to get the image from the camera in the best quality format possible b  Flash too strong  The camera doesn t offer the usual flash options like fill  red eye  etc  It basically has a high  normal and low setting which I think are all too strong and tends to wash out the image  In low light situations  I normally turn off the use of the flash because I find the exposure comes out better but I have to be cafeful and hold the camera still or the picture blurs  I have read about putting a piece of paper over the flash but I haven t tried that yet  Also  some have reported red eye problems with the flash b  Supplied 4MB memory stick too small  I can store about 8 10 stills at the highest quality and resolution and only about 3 4 videos at 320x240  When I m traveling  I am able to get by with a 16MB memory stick for the whole day and evening  storing about 20 30 pictures and some videos  Occasionally I run out of room and start using the 8MB memory stick b  Start up and recording time  I don t know how well the F55 compares to other digital cameras in terms of speed but there is a couple seconds delay when it starts up after I turn it on and when it records images and movies  Basically all digital cameras I ve used have been like this and it gets annoying when timing is critical  When you try the cameras out in the store  keep this in mind b  Lack of focus  aperature  film speed settings  The only options available are white balance  indoor outdoor  and exposure  b Purchasing  When I purchased this camera  it was about  899 retail and I got it at Fry s for  799 plus a 8MB memory stick for about  39  I returned the camera a week later because I found a Sony employee in the area selling his camera for  650 on eBay  I not only got the camera plus the accessories it normally comes with  battery  recharger  AC adapter  serial cable  4MB memory stick  and software  but a soft leather case  a PCMCIA card  for laptop  a 16MB memory stick and another 4MB memory stick  which came with the PCMCIA card The retail price for the camera has dropped since my purchase but my advice is to go to the electronics store to use and look at the camera  Then find the best deal by shopping online and looking at auctions and stores that don t require you to pay tax  Buying from a local store is still the best option for people that want to get it immediately and like having the option to return or exchange it easily b Conclusion  Some newer models have come on the market in the U S  since I got the F55  Just from visiting the Sony Web site  I see that they now have the DSC S30  DSC S50  DSC S70  and DSC F505 which address the USB support  TIFF file format  and zoom options  The F55 is a great digital camera and I recommend it only because I ve been happy with the results but I will probably upgrade to a newer model in the future because they are available Here is a gallery of photos I ve taken with the F55 http www zing com album id 4294236267 User reviews of F55 at dcresource com http www dcresource com reviews

Camera, Even though I see a few others have already written excellent reviews of this camera  I m still excited about purchasing mine   and thought I d chime in After doing a considerable bit of price feature comparisons for a digital camera in the  200 and under category  I ended up with the Kodak CX4300  WalMart sells them for  179 95  only  30 more than the price of the comparable 2 1 megapixel version For the money  I think this camera covers all the important bases  You get an LCD screen to preview your photos  which you re not going to have on the sub  100 dig  cameras as a rule  a glass lens instead of a lower quality plastic one  a built in flash with red eye reduction  a key feature  IMO  plus ability to use only  fill flash   also key  a timer  so you can get into your own photos  the best resolution in its class  at 3MP  and backed by a company that s been doing cameras and film for a LONG time Compared to some other digital cameras I ve used  including a  700 or so Sony Mavica  I think this Kodak does an impressive job of properly capturing colors and handling indoor lighting   On the Mavica I used  I often had problems with indoor photos coming out too dark  and requiring some touch up in Photoshop before they looked really good  As for colors  the cheaper digital cameras often don t capture darker shades of red burgandy maroon properly  I had no such issue with this Kodak On the downside though  the camera does have a few small flaws and faults  My lens cap fits fine  unlike one reviewers  apparently  but I m not really thrilled that it has one in the first place  Their cheaper 2 1MP camera has a built in lens cover that shutters over the lens whenever you switch off the power  I d prefer that so there s one less thing to lose or break  I also ran into the problem of the directional toggle button accidently thinking I pushed a direction when I was trying to push down the middle of it to confirm a menu choice  Some sort of true optical zoom would have been nice  too  I think I would have paid an extra  20 25 for that  if it was available I also agree with the reviewer who complained that at  70  the optional  EasyShare dock  is a marketing ploy  How hard is to push a USB cable into the side of the camera and have your PC auto detect it and start transferring photos  The camera simply doesn t  need  a dock to make this operation easier  The charger built in the dock is great  but it should have come with the camera  
Camera, With my best friend living on the other side of the country  I got a little tired of constantly describing things I had purchased or what size the herbs I was growing had gotten  I decided that I would invest in a digital camera and send her pictures instead  Believe me  I wasn t that great at describing things  and often left my best friend saying   quot Uh  I guess I can picture it quot  Now  I just take a pic  download it onto my computer and send it to her in a matter of minutes I researched and came across the Olympus D 360L  I was attracted to the relatively low price  299  and the high amount of megapixel for the price  1 3  I also liked that it could be used on both an IBM and Mac  Having an LCD screen was very important to me too  The camera is very sleek looking and is easy to carry  There is an optional carrying case that you can purchase  The LCD viewing window allows you to see the shot immediately  so you can delete the ones you don t like  That way  every shot you keep is a good one  It s also fun to take silly pics without worrying that you ll be wasting space  The camera has a menu of functions  such as the quality of shot you want  date time print  cropping a shot  shutter speed  etc  You can also adjust the flash for an indoor shot  overcast day or an outdoor shot  It also has a sequence function  where it will take several shots right in a row  It has a timer also  The quality of the pictures are excellent  Several people have commented on how much detail the pictures have and how crisp they are  The camera comes with a program that allows you to edit the picture on your computer  The camera can take lots of shots  more if you use a lower quality of shot  I ve never had a problem with it running out of space  If you are on a long trip  however  you might want to download onto a computer more often I ve used the camera both indoors and outdoors and I ve never been disappointed in the camera s performance  I have been disappointed in how I look in the pic  but that s not the poor camera s fault lol One of the problems I have with the camera is the menu is a bit confusing without the manual  Also  it uses up batteries pretty quickly  4 AAA  I purchased rechargeable batteries  which have solved the problem and have saved a lot of money I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a moderately priced digital camera that offers a lot of features  The camera is sleek and light and take wonderful pictures  Your friends and family will love getting such wonderful pictures from you br br  
Camera, I needed a digital camera for my online business  so my hubby  who is the techie in the house  started researching cameras  He has won some photography awards and I was willing to defer to his judgement even though it seemed that the one he picked out was a bit complex for me  Well  I should have listened to the inner voice The Olympus D 600L has a lithium battery for the flash  For regular operation it takes 4 AA batteries  Actually  I should say it  eats  them because they do not even last through one session  There are power supplies that will work and I do recommend that you get one because otherwise you will need to buy stock in Duracell The camera is large and does not come with a carrying case  As it is an expensive piece of equipment that  to me  is a serious flaw  There is a built in flash and a zoom lens  but only a 3X zoom so you can t get really  close up  from  far away  All of the operating buttons are easily accessible on the back and top  but there are a lot of them and you really need to know what they mean The screen that shows the picture you have just taken reflects a fair amount of light  so you really can t see it well in the sun  That is also where instructions and settings appear for fixing the brightness and detail of the pictures and this can be a real problem on a nice day  There is an instruction book but it is long and somewhat difficult because it is in three languages on each page so you have to look for the one you understand best  It would have been better to just put them in sections of English  French and Spanish The Olympus D 600L does not self adjust AT ALL  If you do not get the settings just right the colors are way off  Since I sell clothing  this is a major problem for displaying my products Overall  I am not thrilled with this product  It will take nice pictures  but so will some of the simpler digitals  Perhaps for an expert it is a superior camera  but for someone with minimal experience it is a maximal pain to use br br  
Camera, I have a Sony Mavica FD83 that I have been very pleased with in terms of decent shots  decent color  However  it is very bulky to take  and it ends up staying at home  In addition  on a vacation  dealing with fifty floppies is daunting to say the least  So  I wanted a small take anywhere camera that I could take on vacation  I settled on the Nikon Coolpix 885 because of Nikon s reputation and because of a few positive online reviews of the camera  The camera is well made and fairly easy to use  What the problem is and this is something that I could have known had I read reviews on the digital web sites is that it had a MARKEDLY red coloration to pictures  especially indoors  This was noticed not only by myself  an avid amateur photographer  but also by my wife and my mom both who are point and shooters  It was so bad that I returned the camera for a loss  and had to sell  again at a big loss  the rechargeable battery and charger that I bought for it  While we are on the subject  I think it is horrible marketing to sell the camera without the recharger and rechargeable battery  This is a 120 dollar  hidden cost  because no one in their right mind is going to buy expensive throwaway batteries for their camera  Nikon s customer service was about as unconcerned as they could be  In spite of many user comments and complaints about this problem  they denied it completely  The technical person said that he thought this problem MIGHT be fixed in the next firmware upgrade  but had no information  since those technicians are in Japan and don t communicate what they are working on to the US technical staff  As a result of this  I will never ever purchase a Nikon product again  I went out and did some more research  and ended up with a Canon Powershot S110  which cost 330 dollars  I could not be happier with this tiny gem of a camera  and i take it everywhere  
Auto, Note  I just leased my new Jetta a week ago today I test drove quite a few cars before deciding on the 2000 Jetta GL the Honda Civic  the Jeep Cherokee  and the base Saturn model  the SL  among them  They were all very good cars  mechanically solid with a smooth ride  affordable even with some essential extras  and dependable So why the Jetta  Basically  it came down to the design and the feeling that design gives the occupants of the car  especially the driver  The Jetta has that solid yet elegant industrial feel to it the design of the interior and exterior of the other cars seemed cookie cutter in comparison  The Jetta interior and exterior convey a sense of reliability  adventure  cleanliness  stability  and even excitement all rolled into one br br  
Camera, Take an old pro who has used most of the world s best cameras   Leica  Contax  Linhof  Nikon  Canon and Olympus  and buy him his first digital camera  and this is what you get First look  new and right out of its package  first impression  flimsy Yes  this little plastic wonder does not radiate confidence that it will last very long under professional use  It weighs next to nothing and except for the word   quot Olympus quot  in bright silvery letters and the word   quot Camedia quot  in red  the rest of it is midnight black  It comes with a set of lithium batteries  non rechargable  and a wafer sized infra red remote control  You will also find three  3  instruction booklets  one each for English  Spanish and French  Each one of these booklets are 223 pages thick and believe me  you are going to need one of them to study every word  This camera s secrets are available through push button programming via 9 buttons and one 5 position dial  These controls govern the whole gambet of the camera s many capabilities which you can read in full within the instruction book  Before you can learn to program all functions of the camera  you may find that you may run down batteries faster than a corn husker s convention shucking husks  I chose to save the exepensive lithium batteries for a time when I would need serious use  and I began using sets of Nicads I had on hand  A fully charged set of Nicads will only last 20 minutes if you are exercising the camera while learning its functions  Olympus recommends AA sized nickel metal hydride batteries and these will give you good service and are rechargable In the learning phase  you might like to buy an AC supply so that you can run the camera as long as you like  but once you are passed the testing stage  it is likely you will be satisfied to rely on the hydrides  The camera uses 4 of these AA batteries and I find that buying two sets  8 cells  you will probably be able to cover a lot of shooting with one set charging and the other set in the camera  Make no mistake  this is a power hungry machine The controls of this camera are ergonomically easy to use but the sequence of button pushing is more awkward than any film camera ever made  you will have to concentrate and learn to go through several levels of button pushing to crank up features you want to use or NOT use  Having said all this  let me now say that this camera is absolutely amazing  I find it extremely accurate and it does some things impossible for film cameras to duplicate  For instance  the panorama feature seamlessly assembles up to ten frames of exposures to make views that stagger the imagination  A full 360 degrees is easy to do  Part of this operation is done in the caamera and part of it is done in the computer by the supplied software  This featurte ONLY works with the OLYMPUS Smart Card in the camera  This is the 16 megabyte card that comes with the camera  Additional cards maybe purchased but are quite expensive  100 for a 32 Meg  Smart Card I do not like the lens projecting out from the camera when the power is turned on  The plastic barrel surrounding the lens when it extends is a loosly fitting and cheap looking device that makes the camera look like it came out of a Cracker Jack box  hardly resembling a camera that costs nearly a thousand dollars  In fact the whole camera looks like cheap junk  but yes  it does do everything it is advertised to do  Experimentally  I enlarged one high resolution frame to 16 quot  x 20 quot  scale  cropped to 8 5 quot  X 11 quot  and was quire pleased with the resultant photograph  I think once I become more adept at programming this camera I would not hesitate to use it professionally  But this camera is not for everyone  Most casual users will probably never want to disable the flash  or over ride the automatic features which is precisely why I wanted this camera  If only automatic features are wanted one would do better by buying a simpler digital camera that would be easier to set up  For me  I like to be able to do side lighting with strobes  I like to shoot existing light  I like to do bounce lighting  and I like to  quot fudge quot  exposures for dramatic effects  I also like to shoot in black and white and yes  this camera can do that and sepia too  Photos in black and white make splendid  full tone scale prints  razor sharp at 8 quot  X 10 quot  and with software  amazing possiblities are available  I don t think I can ever give this camera up  It s great     
Camera, I love this little camera  it takes great pictures you don t have to be a pro to use and the product will last for ever with just a little care the kids teenagers can use it and theres no worry that will break it and there pictures are great to the only thing really missing is a zoom lens that will zoom into space however I find that I really don t need it I feel that if your looking for a camera that will last you for a long time but do not what to mortgage the house this is a great buy  keep your eyes open for sales and save even more br br  
Auto, The Volvo XC90 has  like all Volvos  a truly horrible name  It baffles me that people as nice as the Swedes  150 forward looking  neutral  sauna inhabiting  high living socialists that they are  150 couldn 146t come up with something more friendly than XC90  I know that it 146s probably code for enormous Volvo SUV that looks like a great big car  rather than a box on wheels  and goes like stink but I don 146t like it  It 146s just not blonde enough  Volvos should be called things like Sven or Agneta  But enough of my inane rambling and into the review proper The Volvo XC90 is of course about as Swedish as Bruce Springstein  Conceived in America for America roads  American wallets and American sensibilities it is in fact a posh Ford  No doubt the Swedes were conned into selling to the Blue Oval  a misunderstanding involving a cell phone with poor reception  a Fjord 2 hrs outside of Stockholm and a half gallon of inexplicably expensive Vodka  But sold they were and since then the pressure has been on to produce an SUV Of course the SUV should have been a Volvo concept  Forever the masters of the utilitarian over the sexy  the safe over the breath taking and the roomy  remember those huge wagons  over the sensible  how many people really shifted furniture THAT often  Volvo should have cleaned up in what the UK calls the  145Grass  145n 146 Gravel 146 market  150 allowing its owners to scamper across verges and up long driveways with not a whimper of complaint  Alas the Volvo bank account resembled that of Mike Tyson and so the never got around to developing the car that could define them  until Ford came along  dipped deeper into debt and provided a much needed injection of cash A totally free hand of course was not granted  150 Volvo is now as much a part of the re engineered platform world as any manufacturer and thus the XC90 sits on a platform developed for the S80  Volvo imaginatively called this platform the E2  150 oh to be in their  145namestorms 146  huh  What this does is give the XC90 very car like proportions  Or at least it looks as though it has car like proportions  It is in fact much bigger than it looks  Much  much bigger  Imagine bumping in to Garly Coleman and realizing that he could have a shot at the NBA  A shock  right  Not as much of a shock as the Volvo 146s proportions  Whilst it shares length and width with the S80 it 146s a full 14 inches taller  A riot of headroom  Of course what those extra inches give is the appearance of ground clearance and that high driving position that invokes in us all a feeling of imperiousness So let 146s start by walking around the car  It looks like  well  it looks like a great big Volvo  It 146s very slabby  very angular and has that Swedish aversion to curves that has been the marque 146s signature  From the rear the tail lights absolutely dominate  erupting into huge pillars that seem to make up the entire rear pillars and threaten a Vegas like explosion of light should you set foot on break  There 146s lots of matt black plastic as  145skirting 146  150 no doubt in a bid to establish  145off road credentials 146  150 clean they look a little tacky  but get some mud splashes going and they seem to blend in to the overall design well  The rear spilts 70 30 but seems a little high  necessitating a bend of the knees as you load up the groceries Inside things are a step up from the usual Volvo blandness  There 146s lots of light colors  adding to airiness  There 146s wood that looks like wood and fake aluminum that looks like  erm  fake aluminum  The overall effect is pleasing and the car feels built to last  Dash layout is simple to the point of insulting but again feels very Volvo with only four things  speed  distance  temperature and fuel level  outlined  I found the driving position to be excellent if a little bus like  my wife had more problems  saying that the high wheel and upright position made her feel like a kid behind the wheel of her dad 146s car  She 146s 5 146 4 148  I think  She also had problems with the thick pillars restricting vision  something I 146ve read about but didn 146t experience myself  Seats are great as you 146d expect  with the leather adding a real Volvo smell to the mix  Lumbar support is adjustable and excellent as is the whiplash control  There are lots of seats too  three rows of them doing all manner of clever tricks  folding in numerous ways and demanding a degree in applied algebra to quantify their cleverness  You can even make one row disappear entirely  The back row is less than roomy  not ideal for small kids  too far away to reach  and therefore designed exclusively  as far as I can tell  for those annoying 8 10 year olds who want to play  145rip the arms off expensive future collectables 146  Still the lay out is fine and dandy and everything feels too well made for a car that is ultimately going to be trashed by the carrying of kids  dogs and elderly relative 146s furniture Start her up and things get even sweeter  Volvo may be know for its 5 cyl engines but the 2 9l 6 cyl engine is just as sweet  280lbs of torque below 2 000 rpm is good for initial shunt  or pulling that trailer  and with 268 bhp there 146s plenty of power too  The automatic gearbox does a good job of keeping forward momentum  150 yes there 146s a little turbo lag and you 146re not going to lose many people from he lights but the car pulls and keeps pulling all the way to the redline All wheels are driven  giving safe but unremarkable response  You know what the Volvo is going to do  150 it 146s safe  it 146s unremarkable  not overly involving  150 very Swedish  quite detached and a little cold perhaps but responsive  The car is a pretty relaxing place to be  150 you waft along  a little too upright but feeling quite unnoticed at speeds slightly faster than you 146d imagine  We didn 146t take the car off road but have heard that it copes okay and that 146s good enough  150 you don 146t buy something this plutocratic to get it dirty down on the farm Head quickly into a corner and you 146re going to feel your lunch rising in your throat  150 this isn 146t a taut car by any measure but one  150 that measure being other SUVs and against those it more than holds its own Safety of course is a Volvo advantage  though Renault beat them  and this car is no exception  Here are some of the unique safety features  taken from the website  assume that every other safety feature is included  150 you 146ll be right 149 Roll stability control  ft  gyrosocopic sensoring  It won 146t roll over then 149 Full length  145curtain 146 airbags  protecting every seat 149 All seat seatbelt pre tensioners 149 Lower cross members  150 saving you from  145mounting 146 other cars in case of accident 149 Pedestrian crumple zones  150 saving people when you mow them down 149 Whiplash protection  150 the front seats move back in case of impact  saving you whiplash Pretty safe then The Volvo is Swedish in the way it 146s equipeed however  150 this car is stacked like a pneumatic blonde  150 with front and rear controls for the climate control  electric driver 146s seat  cruise  nice leather  real wood and a CD player good enough to have in your study So what did we think about the Volvo  Well like Roxette  another fine Swedish export  it was well put together  very professional and perhaps a little too polished  I like to drive   to feel a car moving fluidly with me and the Volvo didn 146t really allow me to do that  150 wallowing through bends when pushed and quietly letting you know that this kind of behavior really isn 146t on And the looks are a bit of a turn off too  It looks exactly as you 146d expect and American Volvo to look  150 supersized  Alas it 146s a look that just doesn 146t come off Of course the Volvo wasn 146t made for me  It was made for people with children  And dogs  And all the stuff that comes with children and dogs  It was designed to deal with the baggage  physical and emotional  the desperate need for safety above all and the even more desperate need for a little space that having kids brings  That and to look suitably expensive  not to mention expansive  on the lawn  With that in mind this car is a complete success Now where did I put those condoms  
Auto, I am writing this opinion because I feel I m fairly educated in regards to Jeep Wranglers being that I have owned two myself  My first Jeep was a rebuilt 1979 CJ 7  This was a great SECOND car but by no means a reliable car to drive everyday  I used this car for entertainment purposes only due to the fact that it was an extremely bumpy ride  not comfortable for long periods of time driving and very loud  The car I specifically writing about is my last previous car which I drove for two years  This was a 1997 Jeep Wrangler Sport 4X4  If you are interesting in purchasing this car there are many pros and cons that I feel you should know about  I guess a few years after selling my  79 Jeep I began to think that I really wanted a newer model  So  I began my research PROS It s no doubt a  quot fun quot  vehicle  I live in a major city so most of my driving time was city miles  Many days of the summer spent with the top down and is no doubt an eye catcher for many people  At night  it was wonderful to drive with the top down  I had a 6 cylinder which came in handy in pulling my jet skis  but my sister has a 1999 Jeep wrangler 4 cylinder and it handled the load with no difficulty either  I opted for more power which driving on the highway in Dallas is almost a necessity to get on the highway  More power   faster speed in less time  CONS If you are interested in a Jeep  please consider opting for the extended warranty  I bought my 1997 jeep in the first of 1998 with little miles  I purchased the extended warranty which came in handy  My factory warranty ended at 36 000 miles and it 40 000 miles the top formed a tear in the seam extended from the windshield all the way to the back of the top of the jeep  At 60 000 miles my differential axle busted which was a whopping  2 000 at the dealership that was covered by the extended warranty all the while the furnished a rental car for me to drive  Fortunately  the wheel base in the model is wider than previous years so I felt comfortable driving at speeds of 70 80 miles without worrying about flipping but the wind noise on the soft top was uncomfortable and extremely loud  No doubt over time you will get used to this noise or you will end up selling because of it  You either like it or hate it  I grew to like it because I upgraded my stereo system to drown out some of the noise  Another con is the soft tops  This is no doubt a welcoming invite for thieves to enter your car  Over a two and a half year span  I had my car broken into 4 times  3 of which the thief entered my car by slashing the plastic windows  This is also a hassle if you don t have a garage  For me  I don t have a garage  This also meant  that every time I wanted to take my top off  which alone is a strenuous process that can take up 20 minutes  I had to also put it back on at the end of the day  It is inevitable that your plastic windows over time will become somewhat of a foggy or less transparent look  Mine in case were scratched very easily  Another issue to address is space  I forgot how much of a packrat I am and how much stuff I actually lug around  This is not the vehicle for you if you are the same  I could never go anywhere and leave anything at all in my car for fear of it being stolen  Every time I remember this  it was always too late  I was already where I needed to be and totally forgot and would end up lugging around a big duffle bag at the mall for example  Most people would probably remember these things  but again  I m not like most people so I m touching on this topic for a FYI for some who it would also apply to Overall  I would say this car would be perfect for someone in their teens to midtwenties  I m 26 and after having the luxuries of a car  began to miss those luxuries after driving a jeep  I would love to own another one  but not as my primary means of transportation Revised 6 26 00 As per request on a comment  I ll give a little more helpful info  As I said before  my sister has a Jeep practically identical to mine  One major difference is the seating  I opted for the vinyl seats which was a big mistake  In the summertime  it gets extremely hot and very easy to sweat  My sister had cloth interior which was extremely comfortable  The vinyl seats also with time developed cracks which should not have happened because I always kept them clean and cleaned them with the recommended solution  The seats were pretty comfortable in regards to adjustments but the material in the vinyl made them uncomfortable  In regards to how it handles  I put 30 quot  tires on my Jeep so it handled relatively well  The only time s  it somewhat scared me was when I unexpectedly took a corner and found out the street was a tad wet and I did a complete 180  That took me for a little loop  Over the course of owning my Jeep  I did this several times  But  it handled really well     
Camera,   Background   I do not own this camera  but a friend of mine got it for Christmas and I spent some time playing with it  and here are my thoughts on it b  Camera Asthetics   The camera itself looks pretty cool  It s small size allows it to be placed easily into most pants coat pockets One of the things I noticed right off the bat was  in place of a manual lens cover  there is an automatic protective barrier instead which opens and closes when you turn the camera on or off  That is pretty handy to me  because on my Olympus C4040  which is a larger camera  the lens cap tends to be somewhat of a pain if it s windy outside and you re trying to take pictures  it blows around and may even hit the camera as the cap dangles from its cord Speaking of power on  that is something I don t like about the Sony  you have to turn  power on  and then select your shooting mode  On the Olympus you simply turn the dial and it comes on  ready to go  No extra step The 1 5  LCD has a surprisingly high resolution  When reviewing pictures  I was amazed at how clear and crisp the images were Menu navigation was fairly intuitive  but since I didn t have the manual  some of the symbols were a little cryptic and I couldn t figure out what they were  If you ve had previous experience with digital cameras or photography  you shouldn t have any problems with this camera    Picture Quality   The various image resolutions to choose from are shown below for the included 32 MB Memory Stick Memory Fine Standard 2592x1944  5MP  12 23 2592x1728  3 2  12 23 2048x1536  3MP  20 37 1280x960  1MP  50 93 640x480  VGA  196 491 The images we were shooting with the camera were mostly at the 2048x1536 standard resolution at 3MP  The color detail at this level was very impressive  We were inside a restaurant with other friends at the time  and all the pictures came out looking amazing  Were they as good as ones shot with my 4MP Olympus  I don t know  but if I had to guess  the color detail was better with the Sony than I would have gotten shooting with my camera Some MPG VX video was shot  and WOW I was really impressed with the quality of video taken in the low light restaurant situation  It wasn t grainy at all  and the frame rate and audio sync were excellent  I think the file end up being almost 7MB for about 20 seconds I wouldn t suggest using the camera as a camcorder though  but it is good to know that it does have this ability should the need ever arise b  Things to Consider   BATTERIES This particular Sony model uses a proprietary Sony Battery  Model NP FC11  I personally find this as somewhat of a big negative on the camera  from a casual user standpoint  for the following reasons 1  To buy an additional rechargeable battery is  49 95  EVERYONE needs at least one additional  if not two additional batteries  If you travel and are out away from your hotel room or ship room  and your battery dies during your excursion down in the Kileua Caldera on the big island of Hawaii  then what are you going to do  You see my point  You should always carry multiple batteries 2  Along the obvious same lines as  1  it doesn t use standard AA batteries which can be bought from just about anywhere at anytime True Story Example  Last year I was at a professional women s billiards tournament in Tunica  MS  A lot of famous people were there  and I was taking pictures like there was no tomorrow  both of the famous people  and me with the famous people  Towards the end of the day  I had completely exhausted my original set and backup set of batteries  but there was still more to do  So  being about 30 minutes from our hotel room  I just went to the hotel store and picked up a pack of AA batteries  popped  em in and shot the rest of the night If I would have had a cam that used special batteries  I would have been screwed  So that s my main hang up on batteries and digital cameras GET A CARD READER I highly recommend getting the card reader accessory from Sandisk  It s cheap  20  and allows for some major convenience when transferring pics to your computer  If you use Windows XP  it s a plug and play device  I borrowed my friends  came in  hooked it up to the USB port on my puter and transferred the files off the memory stick with no problems  The computer treats the Memory reader as a separate disk drive  Kewl CARRYING CASE   That s up to you  I don t have one  but my friend bought one for the Sony  I personally think  in most situations they can be more trouble than they are worth  Especially if you are travelling  but it depends on your travel situation EXTENDED WARRANTIES   These days technology advances at such a rapid pace  in 12 months  the camera will only be worth a fraction of what you paid for it  It is for this reason  I do not recommend the purcahse of extended warranties on electronic items  By the time the standard warranty has expired  99 times out of 100 you re better of junking it  and buying something new and better  many times for less than what paid for what you re throwing away b  Conclusion   The camera is pretty expensive  retailing for  450  so it may be out of some people s price range  However  it s small size and high quality images make it a pretty good contender if those things are important to you  
Auto, I have purchased a 2002 Ford Focus SE Wagon in Fort Knox Gold  The handling is that almost of a European sports car  A very quiet and comfortable interior with three cupholders  height adjustable driver s seat  pencil holder  and a center armrest with storage inside  The car s engine is very smooth and quiet  yet eager to rev up to fast speeds  Even fully loaded with 5 people  the wagon still gets up to speed  although without quite as much pep  The handling  of European design  is unmatched in its price range  The wagon handles just as well as the sedan  A great sound system includes a standard CD player with Automatic Volume Control and a removable anti theft panel built in  It also comes standard with remote keyless entry to unlock doors  or even the tailgate  The tailgate can also be unlocked from the inside via a button on the drivers side  or with a standard key from the outside  Theatre dimming lights are a nice soft touch  The seating position is comfortable in all seats  and a tilt telescoping enables anyone to find a comfortable seating position  It s amazing Ford can include all these wonderful options at such a low price  This is the best fully loaded car money can buy for under 20  The wagon body of the Focus is by far the best  With slight adjustments made in suspension the wagon rides better  has just as much pep as the sedan  can easily carry more  and has better rear end styling  Why not get the wagon  Wagons are becoming increasingly more popular  and it s not hard to see why  
Camera, Being only the second digital camera I have ever used  I m going to say that HP315 is a pretty nice little camera  It is best made for whoever wants to take some nice quality pictures and is willing to take a step forward with the technology  It is relatively small  smaller than the SLR models and is not heavy at all  The photo quality is great  much better other similar cameras  that are in the same price range It has 2 1 megapixels and you can choose if you want to shoot in regular  fine  or superfine mode  Naturally  superfine requires more memory on the 8 MB card  only allowing you to take a total of 10 superfine photos before you download them onto your computer  In regular mode you can take up to 50  There is a 1 8 inch color screen on the back of the camera  allowing you to view and select photos for deletion or downloading  To take pictures you can either just look through the viewfinder or turn on the LCD and look through that  Using the LCD does however drain the battery rather quickly  so I try to avoid it unless I want to view already taken pictures  The HP315 does have a 2 5 digital zoom  However  to take pictures using the zoom is a bit difficult  You have to turn on the LCD to do this  draining battery  However  it does help to produce beautiful shots  Overall  I would say that this is a great little camera  It has a nice weight  is easy to operate and has handy little rubber grips on it so that you don t drop it  If you have the money  you should look into it br br  
Camera,  IMAGE SIZE b  3 2 mega pixels  Viewed on my PC  the images look great and are huge  I don t print photos  so I cannot comment on the print quality b ZOOM b  10x optical 4x digital   Optical zoom is the most important factor here i  Most digi cams have only a 3x or 4x optical zoom  I specifically wanted a longer zoom so I could use the camera for sports   outdoors photography  Digital zoom doesn t matter at all  since I m not printing directly from the camera  I can always use photo editing freeware on my PC to digitally zoom  I haven t turned the digital zoom feature back on since I tested it useless to me b FOCUS b  Rapid auto focus or manual focus  The Rapid AF is very fast and has kept my images perfectly focused so far  I m very impressed with the manual focus feature  easy to activate  easy to use  and a rare feature in most cameras these days   Manual focus will only be useful for certain photography  so if you want a point and shoot  this is a useless feature i  My girlfriend shoots art photos  so she loves the manual focus b FLASH b  Auto flash  auto flash w  red eye reduct  manual flash    fill flash  The fill flash setting is used for dark photographs where you want to see background details  Fill flash has a long shutter time  so your subject needs to stay still   you need a tripod to use it   Of course  you can turn flash off altogether  There is also an accessory shoe on this camera for using other flashes  The built in flash is powerful enough to illuminate objects 20 feet or so away b MOVIE RECORDING b  Record up to 640x480 movies at either 15 or 30 frames per second  30 fps is great for a digital camera  However  recording at 640x480 at 30 fps takes about 1 MB per second of movie time   If you want to make digital movies  get a digital movie camera  I don t care to use my still cam for movies  so this feature didn t matter to me at all i  I did try this feature just for S G  when played back on the camera LCD screen  audio was slightly out of sync w  video  Haven t tried it on my PC yet b MACRO MODE b  Super Macro mode allows you to take photos of objects as close as 4 cm from the camera lens b FAST STARTUP b  This camera will startup uber fast  Ready to shoot a photo in less than 2 seconds from when you touch the power button  No title screens  no brand name shots  no menu screen at startup   This is one of my favorite features  Every digital camera I ve ever used takes 10 seconds or more to start up  sometimes up to 20 seconds  I ve often missed photo opportunities because of long startup times i b VIEWFINDER b  There is no real viewfinder for this camera  You see exactly what is going to be recorded  with photo information overlaying the view  The viewfinder is the same view as the LCD screen  reflected to the eyepiece using a mechanical mirror  The mirror thing was a good idea  saves money on separate screens  But the camera has to be on to frame a potential subject  And the extra mechanics are more likely to get damaged than a passive viewfinder b NOTABLE FEATURES b  Custom or auto white balance control  dark noise reduction  creative color modes  natural color  vivid color  B W  and sepia  programmable flash button  automatic monitor amplification  
Auto, We like to keep our cars quite a long time  which is not hard  since they have been Volkswagens  and during the last couple of years we have them  we go and test drive  everything  that appeals to us at all  so that we are educated when we do finally purchase  We are not blindly loyal to VW  but they just seem to have the most car for the money most of the time  The  98 VW Passat was redesigned for that year  and it was just so refreshingly new  We liked it from the first test drive  It felt heavier than the Jettas and Golfs that we were used to  and it has the 15  wheels  which means a smoother ride than the 14  or smaller wheels  This was the first car this large that we would be buying  There is so much leg room and head room  and the seats are the most comfortable that VW has offered  Once we drove the Passat  we were sold  We bought the 4 cylinder standard transmission model with the heated leather seats  We had never had heated seats  and I had thought  Boy  what a gimmick  Well  unless the weather is quite warm  those heated seats are just great  Even of a moderately cool day  it feels good to get in and warm up the seats  even if we turn them off soon  This item just makes a world of difference in the comfort level  and people who have ridden with us have been very impressed Our Passat is a light aquamarine called Elegant Green  and it does turn heads  It is a beautiful  soft shade I also rate the back seat favorably  It is roomy and comfortable  with the head room and leg room for adults to ride in back  and we have had a number of people say that it is the most comfortable and roomy back seat they have ever been in  I think many manufacturers look at the back seat as where the kids and maybe the dog rides  so how nice does it have to be  Volkswagen makes every seat in the Passat comfortable for  adults Unlike  it seems  most people  I don t car for a sun roof or moon roof  so I cannot comment on VW s  since our Passat does not have one We have had very little trouble with this car  In fact  I don t recall any repairs  We just got the regular maintenance  We did have the front brakes relined  which surprised us a little  since we normally go a long time between brake jobs  but then  this car is heavier than our previous ones  Nothing has actually broken on the car  Reliability is the most important thing to us  and I think we got this with the Passat The main negative for me is the air conditioning  We live in the West Virginia northern panhandle  where we certainly don t have the kind of hot weather they get in Miami or Phoenix  but I find the air conditioning to be just adequate  I don t want the inside of the car to be frigid anyway  and with only moderately hot summer weather  the air conditioner is ok  it is adequate  It just seems such a shame to me that they could build this wonderful car with the posh seats and beautiful styling  and then put in an air conditioner that is just not in the same league with the rest of the car  Surely the ones they put on the market to sell in the South have different and better systems in them  This a c is just rather disappointing Like a couple of other posters here  I would like more cup holders  and maybe in metal rather than plastic in the front  where we use them a lot I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a smooth ride with ease of handling in a car whose watchword is  reliability  I would not recommend it to people who want really frigid air conditioning  For those buying in hot climates  I would say  Take it for a long ride in the heat of the day and test that a c out before you buy  
Auto, I am renting Dodge Stratus because one of our vehicles is in the shop  I have to say that I m completely torn on whether or not I like it  The ES that I m driving does have a very sporty appearance and I like the white gauges  The only thing I don t like about the outside appearance is the hubcaps  They look terrible  I haven t done a lot of homework on this car so I don t know whether or not the car even comes with aluminum wheels or what the wheels look like if they do Inside the car  I don t feel like it s really that comfortable  I absolutely hate the tilt wheel mechanism  I think it s cheap and a pain  The seats are very weird feeling  I don t know what to think of them really  They have good lower  and upper back support  but somewhere in the middle there isn t any  What s that about The legroom is very tight  I m 6 0 quot  and don t have many problems with cars but the Stratus is small  I commute 120 miles a day and I m really not comfortable  I ve been in worse cars   my wife s old Geo Storm  but not many  It s pretty cramped I don t like the controls for the stereo because they are little hard to reach  especially when you have to keep your eyes on the road  You have to eject the tape in order to listen to the radio and learning how to set the presets for FM2 takes awhile to figure out  The dome light turns off when you shut the door not when you turn the key The trunk looks like it s pretty big  The door opens nice and wide but you have to do all the work  If you pop the trunk from inside  the only thing that happens is the latch releases  You have to reach up over the expanse of the trunk opening to open and close it  I was being a little lazy today and only opened the trunk halfway  What resulted is that my wife ended up smacking her head on the door Also  the button to release the rear seat back is a little out of the way  You have to stretch across to the middle in order to get this to work  Come on Daimler Chrysler  is it too much to ask for two buttons  I mean this car is above  15K  Spend a little The actual drive experience of the car is pretty good  It s got plenty of power  The only thing I don t like about this is that whenever I set the cruise control  the car tends to want to jump up a couple miles per hour  I ll set it for 65 and the car will cruise at 67 or 68  It seems to be a little high maintenance  Also  to cancel the cruise control you have to practically slam on the brakes  Most cars you just lightly tap but not the Stratus I know that it has a cancel button on the steering wheel  but who remembers that  I have driven no other car by any other manufacturer that has that feature  I usually end up trying to turn cruise on using that button anyway I m not at all impressed with the Air Conditioning  It takes forever to cool the car down  Our dog  Grimm  the Great Dane  rides to and from work with us and he has done nothing but pant to and from work  Our car has a couple vents in the back seat  but even so it takes a lot to cool that car down As far as my overall impression of the car  I m torn  There s things I like on it  but there s enough that I don t like that I wouldn t buy one  The car is OK  not something you cruise town in and say   quot Hey  look at what I just bought quot  People could care less To get this car to look cool would take new wheels and tires  preferably low profile  and tint  This probably wouldn t look good on the maroon one I m driving though br br  
Camera, I ve always thought that Digital Cameras were one of the most important  147Killer Apps 148 of the technological age  But it has taken until now for the technology to advance enough and produce a product that has the quality and features to truly replace your typical 35mm point and shoot camera  The D510 Zoom from Olympus is a perfect example of such a product Now I ll be honest  I didn t do a whole lot of research before buying my new toy  I knew enough about digital cameras to recognize the features that set them apart  but I had not done any specific research on this camera  But being the gear head I am  when I discovered this gem at a severely reduced clearance price I snatched it up  I knew at that time that Olympus made some very nice cameras in both traditional and digital formats  My impulses on this one seemed to be right on  I have been using the camera for several weeks now  and am incredibly impressed with the convenience a quality digital camera can provide  The camera is a 2 1 Mega pixels  This is basically all the quality you need for almost any application  Pictures for the web turn out great  printed pictures in 4x6 and 5x7 look amazing  you can even stretch it to 8x10 without much of a major impact  1600 x 1200 pictures are produced by most settings  but you can cut down the size to increase the room for pictures  The 3x Optical and 9x Digital is something that is fairly hard to find in a camera in this price range  If your in the camera business  you know that Olympus makes great quality lens  you ll know the a better quality lens will create a better picture  These hold true with the D510  If you do not know the difference between optical and digital zoom  optical is the physical adjustment of the lens to get a closer picture  Digital simply takes the picture then crops and resizes it to the desired zoom  This is only useful if you want a bigger picture and in most cases  the quality is decreased  3X Optical is more then enough for my use  The digital zoom is nice to have but I don t use it much because I can crop if necessary using software on my PC  A beautiful feature Olympus includes is the ability to toggle the use of digital zoom  The zoom button is simply a rocker switch located next to the shutter button  If your using the LCD screen as a view finder  you will notice it will display a visual guide showing how much zoom is currently being applied  This guide also shows when you are making use of digital zoom or just optical zoom  Another small feature  but it illustrates the thought that was put into this design The camera has a host of other features that set it apart from others  USB auto connect gives you an amazing amount of flexibility and allows windows to recognize the camera as an external hard drive and lets your simply drag and drop the files you want  When you combine this with Windows XP s digital camera wizard  you couldn t ask for anything easier  This also allows you to use this camera as a card reader for any of your Smart media cards  Speaking of smart media cards  the camera includes a 8mb card in box  Which allows for just fewer than 20 high quality shots  Turn down the quality slightly and get in upwards of 50 The ability to plug your camera into a video input on a TV is a great addition to the already complete feature set  When your on a trip and don t have the ability to get a hold of a computer for a few minutes to view your pictures  simply plug in the standard RCA output cable and connect it to any TV  An instant slideshow  Olympus was nice enough to include this cable in the package  kudos to you Olympus The Quicktime movie capture feature allows you to take short movie clips  25 seconds long  The length of time and lack of audio capture makes this almost pointless  but I have found that I have used it for recording lab results in various classes at school The D 510 looks great on paper  but how does it perform in the real world Opening the box gives displays various documents including your user manual and software  It has two cables  USB and Video Out  a set of NiMH batteries  a 8mb card  a wristband and the Camera itself  Everything you need to get going is there  although the inclusion of an AC Adapter would have been appreciated The actual camera is somewhat bulky compared to smaller models offered by HP  Canon  and Fuji  The newer D520 shares similar specifications but is almost half the depth of the D510 and does not retain the solid of the D510  The D510 case feels similar to brushed aluminium giving it a professional feel and style  It still fits into a pocket  on my rather large pants  but is better suited to remain in a case in a purse or backpack The pictures that come out of the camera are bright and vivid and I 146ve printed many in a variety of sizes  One of my pictures recently won 2nd place in a photo contest  Picture  Land of the Living Sky available at www barndoorfanclub org gallery twilight twilight html  The variety of shutter speed and aperture settings can be useful for someone with more experience in working with traditional SLRs but I find that letting the camera automatically choose proper settings tends to produce excellent pictures  Having said that  most of my low light pictures turned out less than impressive unless I played with the settings myself  The User Manual includes a great guide on how to take the best pictures in a variety of situations and is worth reading through The software is not very useful  although it does allow you to take a number of shots and digitally  147stitch 148 them together to make a panorama  The results of the stitching function look very professional  I do most of my picture touch ups with JASC Paint Shop Pro  I purchased two things with my camera  A 16mb Smart media card and a small camera case  The 16mb allows me to capture 30 high quality pictures and then the 8mb can be used as a backup  The case protects the camera wherever I go and holds the USB cable and the extra memory card  NiMH rechargeable batteries are on my list of things to pick up  As with most digital cameras  the D510 eats batteries  It is best to keep an extra set with the case as well  The battery life indicator only shows when the batteries are just about to die and will otherwise show a full charge until it 146s too late Reasons to buy    Powerful camera  2 1 MP  3x Optical 9x Digital  These features alone make it a desirable and very functional camera to have  Low cost  The price point I 146ve seen for this camera makes it a viable option for a Christmas present or just as a straight replacement for a 35mm for those new to digital cameras  Impressive picture results  Photos are bright and colourful  perfect for printing with a photo printer or getting professionally printed  It 146s just fun to use  The ability to take a picture of something at a get together  show it on a slideshow later that night  print out a copy for everyone there and then have it posted on a website the next day makes it fun to use Things to watch out for  No camera case  Best to pick one of these guys up  A good one can be had for under  20   Software is Weak  Besides the ability to stitch panorama  the software was relatively weak and only useful as a photo viewer  something that Windows XP does natively quite well  Menu System  Like other reviews  the menus do require some getting used to and I frequently have to refer back to the manual to track down specific features  Some effort could be made to craft a less intimidating system Conclusion The Olympus D510 is a solid performer right of the box  With 2 1 MP and 3x Optical zoom  it is the perfect replacement for a traditional 35mm or SLR user experimenting with the new digital camera technology  Although I do have some complaints about what is included camera and what isn 146t  they are relatively insignificant compared to the quality and usefulness of the camera overall  Out of all the cameras I have tried out before and after the purchase of my D510  I am still impressed with the quality it produces  For the price  the D510 is best of class Update I left my digital camera in my glove box by accident and over the course of two days was involved in some amateur rally racing  Unfortunately I had not left the camera in its case and some of the pixels on the LCD preview screen have gone out  I have not go a hold of Olympus yet but will publish my experiences with technical support as soon as I finalize what is going on  
Camera, Let s begin with what comes out of the box The 4MP Kodak LS443 Camera with built in 16MB memory A docking station A battery AC Adapter USB Cable Let me begin by saying  thanks Kodak for not making us spend 100 extra dollars on things like the AC adapter and batteries which should be included in the first place This is my opinion on the camera  I love it for it s picture quality but I dislike it for not making me feel so great about myself when I take a picture  What does this mean Well  when you see most cameras  the LCD is so crisp you can see if you goofed up the picture when you took it  Therefore  you can quickly erase it and take another snapshot  With the LS443  you take a picture and the display on the screen isn t always all that great so you can t tell if it will be blurry or if there is too much light  Keep this in mind when purchasing the camera  Luckily  the picture quality is so top notch with this camera  I was able to foresee the lack of LCD display As far as the lens is concerned  it is a high end propriety Schneider Kreuznach Variogon lens  There is a 3x optical zoom and 3 3x digital zoom for a total 10x zoom  In case you don t know how the zooms work  this is the difference Optical zoom is a lens change causing a picture to be snapshotted as if you were physically closer to the object you are capturing  This means that the picture is AS GOOD quality as it would be if you were physically near the camera itself Digital zoom is a hardware software approach to  zooming  in on a particular object at a certain distance  This type of zoom causes pixelation and destroys the overall quality of the picture  I don t even bother using digital zoom  I have it turned off  If you are looking to get a camera with great quality and zoom  only look at optical zoom  not digital  If you do look at digital  make sure that the camera is of high megapixels because you will need them when digitally zooming in The autofocus on the camera is great  You hold the button down half way and a little green box on the camera s LCD turns red  This means that the camera is focused and you can depress the button all the way to snapshot the picture  Immediately after that the image is displayed on the screen and you are ready for your next shot Fortunately  Kodak took a huge step is combining the Picture Mode with the Review mode  This means that you can hit the review button at any time in picture mode and it will show you all the pictures stored on the memory card  This helps a lot so you don t have to physically turn the camera into a different mode every time you want to review a picture  There is also an independent Delete and Share button available  That way you can immediately delete a picture if you don t like it  Or you can hit the share button  which will allow you flag the picture to be emailed to a previously set list  via computer software  of possible recipients  As soon as you dock the camera  it will prompt you to email out the pictures you have flagged As far as the modes are concerned on the camera  it contains the following Movie Mode   this is with sound and it also plays back sound  The quality is not so great but you can t expect much from a digital camera  Also  you don t have the ability to zoom in and out during recording since it will make noise and be captured Auto Mode  This mode is great for everyday pictures of people  objects at a reasonable distance  It takes the best picture dependent on the current situation  The autofocus is performed by an independent blue light which shines prior to the snapshot and focuses the camera Sport Mode  This is ideal for objects in motion and will increase the shutter speed thus trying to avoid blurriness Macro Mode  This is for objects that are closer than 28cm  Flash is automatically disabled and this option works great  I ve used it many times  Night Time Mode  This is great for night time when light is readily available  The shutter speed is decreased and hence more light is absorbed  However  this means that even a slight shake in your hand will output a blurry image  Thus you need some sort of tripod when taking these types of pictures Landscape Mode  This sets the lens to infinite focus  There is no redbox greenbox to indicate focus  This mode works fantastic and I ve used it many times to take great pictures of scenery As far as the options are concerned on the camera itself  you have the ability to set it to multiple mode which will take up to 3 shots in a row  Works great for objects in motion  You also have the ability to change the flash type to automatic  always on  red eye reduction or off  Red eye reduction is a little weird since it flashes twice instead of flickering first and then flashing  This means your guests will assume that the picture was taken on the first flash and start to move right at the time the actual picture is taken  Be careful of this and warn them ahead of time The pictures can be taken in color  black and white  or sephia  the olden days look There is control to increase or decrease white exposure  for snowy days or days there is too much or too little light There is the ability to set the quality of the picture  You can make it the full 4 Megapixels  2 2 Megapixels or  1 Megapixel  With a 128MB card  you can take 103 pictures at best quality As far as the cards are concerned  this camera uses a Secure Digital   MultiMedia card  These are generally much more expensive than compact flash or smart media  However  it has 16MB of internal memory which is used once the card is filled  The camera comes with a docking station  When you place the camera on the docking station  it begins to charge and immediately allows you to transfer over pictures to your computer  Charging time is about 2 hours which is much better than the Sony DSC P71 which requires 13 hours  An excellent feature of the camera is that you can physically connect the same AC adapter and same USB that goes into the docking station  right into the side of the camera  This means you can transfer pics to any computer without carrying around the entire docking station  However  take note that the AC adapter  when plugged directly into the camera  will not charge it but will let you take infinite amount of pictures without a battery No matter where you  you will find the AC adapter costs much more and the battery charger is a standalone device  Kodak simplifies our life by including all this in the package Drawbacks of this camera also include the fact that there is no way to check the battery life unless it s dying in which a battery indicator comes on the LCD  Usually you can take about 75 pictures WITH the LCD on and upto 300 pictures with the LCD off  Be prepared to buy an extra battery  These batteries are proprietary and can only be bought in select places  Luckily they are dirt cheap  You can get a battery additional wall charger great for travel  for about 25 dollars if you look around online  One other thing that I would love to have seen would have been an additional text LCD display which showed number of pics remaining  battery indicator and few other required options  This way you wouldn t have to have the LCD on most of the time  However  for the price  you can t expect to have everything I chose this camera because I wanted the quality of the pics to be great  not for just the features  What you are looking for is up to you  Good luck with buying a digicam and I hope you are as satisfied as I was with my purchase  
Auto, Everyone told me not to buy the avenger because I was planning on starting a family and it wouldn t be practical  They were wrong  wrong  wrong I bought the car because it was affordable and sporty but it is much more than that I have had it for three years and the only thing I must warn you about is the front bumper  It is very low and get scratched up really easily  I keep a tube of white car paint to fix it up There is one more disadvantage   the tires and wheel coverings are very expensive to replace Other than that  the only thing I have had to fix were the brakes and that is probably due to my driving habits The seats are very comfortable and easily adjust any way you want them to  The trunk is huge  I fit a large stroller in there and an entire load of groceries  There are two pockets in each door to store things and two storage bins in the middle  There are also two middle cup holders As for the family  I have no problem putting my son into his carseat  I would recommend this car for anyone who wants a sporty vehicle at a good price     
Auto, The Audi allroad quattro  notice the lowercase  is an incredible vehicle that combines the luxury  power  speed  and finesse of a fine German sports sedan with the usability of a street smart SUV After having spent the past 5 years driving a Toyota Corolla I decided to spend a little cash and  upgrade  my vehicle  I needed a vehicle that was large enough to hold all the music equipment I lug around but also one that was zippy enough that I could have fun in while cruising the Florida landscape  I test drove various SUV s from the BMW X5 to the Acura MDX and while they were all nice  they didn t give me the sense of power and speed that I needed  Enter the audi allroad The 250HP 2 6 V6 delivers smooth power no matter which gear and RPM I am in  I ve clocked 0 60 times on it at 6 5 seconds  This car really moves  it beats the other SUV s  hands down  in terms of power and speed  I also love how useful the car is during city driving  The height adjustable suspension allows me to lower the car during high speed and city driving  This gives it a zippier and less truck like feel  However  if I need to go over a median or tree limb or something similar  I raise it to highest level and in a few seconds I have SUV towering height  I recommend this car for anyone looking for a high quality  sports sedan with the practicality of an SUV  The slightly high price gives you complete luxury inside  wood trim  leather  power everything  and Audi has not forgotten anything in their design  The gas mileage is my only complaint with this fine vehicle  With the Corolla I was getting 29 MPG City and now I am averaging 17 18  depending on how I drive  It s cleaner and more efficient than most SUV s but I would recommend you go with a smaller SUV  Like the Toyota RAV4  if you re worried about gas consumption I ve had my allroad for almost two months with zero problems and extreme delight  For me  this vehicle is pure luxury utility speed  It s a perfect match for those looking for a fast  usable vehicle  
Camera, That was the deciding factor for purchasing this camera  I still believe that your camera is only as good as what it can see and that is what the Sony F505V offers  A Carl Zeiss lens with a 5x optical zoom My husband and I have been wanting a new digital camera for a while now  so when we got a nice bonus from his employer  that was it  we were off to the Good Guys to choose between this camera and the Nikon Coolpix 990 Besides the lens  need I say more  we liked the optional memory stick floppy adapter  not included  which makes it easy to download to any computer  It also has AV jacks  cable included  for viewing on your TV or on the road in a hotel room  One of the features  and there are many  we like a lot is the email mode  Along with the resolution you choose for the picture it will also save a small email size picture  Great for the grandparents No one camera out there has all the features that we wanted in a camera  So there are trade offs  We really wanted a real viewfinder  the LCD on the 505V just does not cut it  The glare can be most annoying  the swivel LCD does help a bit as does the LCD adjustable light  The memory stick is nice and small but no real grips on it to get it out of the camera easily The memory stick included with the camera is 8 meg  so it is necessary to buy another  We went with the 64 meg at an extra  140  Ka ching Then another battery is a necessity at  80  Ka ching  ka ching But  I do have a wonderful lens br br  
Auto, Well  I ordered my PT Cruiser 3 1 and finally picked it up 6 21  I absolutely love it  Handles great and has plenty of power for me  I ve never had a speeding ticket before  but probably will with this vehicle  Can t get over the way it corners  Only drawback is a paint problem little white spots all over  that should be taken care of soon  Gas mileage is getting better every day only have 650 mi on it so far  It does attract a lot of attention  Plan on extra time whenever you take it out  because people always stop you and want to see talk about it  Keep the windex handy too for the inevitable nose prints on the windows when you return  Anyone who wants a multipurpose vehicle that stands out will appreciate the PT cruiser Okay  I keep forgetting that not everyone is a PT cruiser nut  Sorry  The PT Cruiser is made by the Daimler Chrysler Corp  and is like nothing else on the market at this time  The styling reminds me of an old Ford sedan i e  the flared fender the roofline  etc It is powered with a 2 4L 4 cylinder 16 valve DOHC engine which has been used in other vehicles  but slightly reconfigured  There have been some complaints about it being sluggish  but I have not found this to be true  It is heavy for it s size a little over 3100 lbs I have had it up to 80 mph and the handling is excellent holds the corners very well  After 650 miles  I am getting 21 mpg in town and 23mpg town highway  Mileage continues to improve with breaking the engine in  Interior is roomy and comfortable I have been watching this vehicle since it was a concept car  I firmly believed that I would never buy a NEW vehicle again  but this one changed my mind  Ordered without having seen one in person only pictures  or even test driving  I have not been disappointed by any means  The biggest drawback now is the demand  which has created a lengthy waiting period between ordering and delivery  The wait is worth it br br  
Camera, This has made some money for me on Ebay  It is excellent for Ebay  it is so easy to use  No extra buttons to push  very user friendly  I have had it for 5 months  it has certainly paid for itself by doing my auctions  I also use it for around the house  my kids love it  They really enjoy looking at themselves right after I take the picutre  It also comes with the software to use it in your computer  Very easy to upload  and very fast too  Once the pictures are taken  it is simple to load in your camera  and then do your thing  either do an auction  or send e mail pictures to your family the ideas are endless This is a great family camera  it is not too expensive  although it is much more than the other cameras  I recommend this to any one trying out their first camera br br  
Camera, After doing research about digital cameras online  I went to Best Buy to try out cameras  My top two choices were a Nikon Coolpix 995 and a Canon Digital Elph  But when I saw the Olympus  I was hooked  I went home  read up on its features  and bought it the same day And what features convinced me  The 10X optical zoom is unparalleled in a camera of the C700 s size and cost  Serious photographers can override any automatic setting  aperture  shutter speed  focus  white balance  and emulated ISO setting  And it works with Linux But nothing s perfect  My biggest complaints are that I had to spend an extra  55 to buy 4 NiMH AA batteries and a 128MB SmartMedia card  The bundled 8MB card only stores 16 pictures at the default settings  Some people may also lament the 2 11 megapixel CCD  many cameras in this price range now have 3 3 mp Some more details This camera is great for anyone from a novice up to a serious amateur  Novices can use the camera as a simple point and shoot and get reasonably good pictures  Serious hobbyists can tinker with the lighting  focus  and white balance and get more interesting pictures in a variety of settings  This is a  having your cake and eating it  too  situation  If you need to take a picture quickly  just hit the shutter button  If you want to get artistic or shoot in unusual lighting  everything s adjustable The user interface makes everything easy to get to  Changing the aperture and shutter speed can be done with one button  Changing the focus takes two  Everything else is in a well laid out two level menu  You can pick three menu settings for top level access The camera takes AA batteries  giving me the choice of Lithium  included  rechargeable  or alkaline in a pinch  I have two sets of rechargeables that I rotate  each lasts several days of normal use The C700 acts as a  USB mass storage  device  which means that it can run with any USB capable OS  including Win98  MacOS  and Linux  The computer treats the camera as an external hard disk and can download 8 MB  16 25 pictures  in about 8 seconds I would very strongly recommend this camera to anyone who wants the flexibility of a digital SLR in a  400  11 oz package One caveat  many of the cheaper vendors are selling either imported grey market cameras  which have no warranty and may not have English language menus  or are selling  bare  cameras without software  cables  batteries  or the 8MB smart card  Make sure you buy the U S  retail box  
Camera, I have used 35mm cameras in the past and some other digital cameras and the Kodak LS443 puts all those other ones to shame  Once you start taking pictures then you will know what I m talking about  When you first download the pictures to your computer  you will be amazed at the picture quality and how vibrant the colors look  Also the camera comes with the docking station that makes the transfer of pictures very fast and easy Now for the review b  Picture quality and memory   First off  the picture quality  The camera has three settings for picture quality  At the highest setting the pictures are very close to what a regular 35mm film camera would do  Also at this setting you can get some great 4 by 6 or 8 by 10 prints  The specifications say you can get up to 20 by 30 prints but I have not tried those  I think the recommended size is up to 11 by 14  With those three sizes this camera is perfect for most users  The highest setting of the camera is 4 mega pixels  the second setting is 2 2 mega pixels and the last setting is 1 mega pixel  I mostly used the 4 Mp setting when taking most of my pictures but I have used the 1 Mp setting when I want to send emails to people  At the highest setting the pictures are about 1 megabyte in size so I would recommend buying a memory card of at least 128 MB  I personally bought a 256 MB card and with that I can take over 200 pictures at the highest quality setting and about nineteen minutes of video in movie mode  The difference in price between the 128 and the 256 MB card is not that much  The actual specifications on how many pictures you can take depending on the card size can be seen at the Kodak site b  Controls   In some reviews that I read some people have said that the shutter button is spongy and it is hard to control  This was not the case with me  To get the camera to take the best pictures possible  you would hold down the shutter button half way and then the camera would automatically set the focus and the flash settings  When it does that then you just press the shutter button all the way down to take the picture  Some people said that it takes a long time to auto focus but this is not the case  The camera is ready to take the picture quite quickly The zoom is quite good  I just recommend that you don t use the digital aspect of it  only the optical  I took a few pictures using the digital zoom and the picture quality dropped off somewhat The camera operates in several modes  The only one that I haven t used yet is the night mode so I cannot comment on it but all the other modes do exactly what they say they can do  For example  my little nephew was running around  so I put the camera in sport mode and the pictures came out great  Very focused with no blurring  This is another thing that other people have complained about and I don t see why  That is why the camera has all these different modes  so you can get the best pictures during different situations The camera also has a lot of manual controls for setting up the exposure  white balance  where to focus  ISO and other things so there is a lot of stuff that novice picture takers can play around with  Most of the time I have the camera set in automatic mode  but to get all the other features to work right you just have to experiment and take pictures in different conditions to see what works best  The manual guide of the camera explains each function pretty well so you can pick up all the features pretty quickly Every time you switch to a new mode  there is a quick explanation of what it does so this makes the camera very easy to operate b  LCD   One of the cons of this camera is the LCD  First of all the picture quality in the LCD is not good at all  When I took a few pictures I thought they were all coming out bad when I viewed them using the review feature of the camera  The photos don t look clear and the colors look a bit off  That is a different case when you see the pictures on a computer  Then you can really see what the camera can do  Also  I was taking some pictures outdoors  and you can barely see the image on the LCD screen  Also at night you can t see anything on the screen  It would have been nice if they would have added controls to the LCD screen to change the contrast or the brightness to adjust to these conditions  These drawbacks are not that bad and can be overlooked because of the picture quality of the camera  
Auto, WHAT A GREAT CAR   quot The Base prices for the BMW 5 Series have not changed from the previous year  in fact BMW has added a few standard features to each of the models to improve their overall value  The Dynamic Stability Control System is now a standard feature on the 528i models  Metallic paint is now a no charge option on the 528i as well  The 540i now comes with standard Xenon headlights and Rain Sensor Wipers  All 5 Series models have available sport packages which come with sport suspension  performance tires  upgraded wheels and the M Sport steering wheel  Another option on the BMW 5 Series is the GPS Navigation System  which includes an Onboard Computer  Emergency Call System  Geographic Disc and Automatic Ventilation System quot br br  
Camera, This is an excellent camera technically  however recent experiences I have encountered have led me to change my mind  The only problem is that there are only a few models available in the market in this category  Please see my previous review It ranks high in lens quality  performance  ease of use  and manual override capabilities The lack of a swivel LCD screen is very sadly omitted by Minolta  The ability to switch between manual and automatic focus by accidentally touching the button is a poor design feature as is the placement of the neck strap ring over the CF door The unadvertised APO shutdown feature is really a sad feature  Minolta should really look into this and either remove it or advertise it so that you are not caught using it while deleting an image at the same time  The end result for me was the corruption of all my images in my CF card  which caused me to spend   to recapture the lost images  The attitude received in the repair department was a real shocker to me  I have never encountered this in my life as a consumer  At Canon I have always been treated as a consumer with respect and professionalism  As a result I will never buy another one of their products in the future  
Camera, I have now owned the Olympus D 400Z camera for over a year  15 months  and without a doubt  can say it s a wonderful camera Since I purchased this camera  they have come out with later models  such as the 450  460  and I think now it s up to 490  They all still use the same lens system to my knowledge  and Smart Media cards for photo storage  The only difference is that the newer models now use rechargable batteries  and the 490 now also offers a  quot Quicktime quot  movie mode so you can take short movies  The D 400Z does not offer a movie mode  but it s still a great camera The 3X optical zoom works well on the D 400Z  The additional 2X digital zoom allows you to bring items in even closer  The photos are always clear  and show great detail  There is even a  quot panoramic quot  mode that allows you to take a series of photos side by side  and then with the included software allows you to  quot stitch quot  them together to make one long  panoramic shot  I ll have to say as well  that taking a number of these panoramic shots  you cannot notice any lines where the photos are stitched together in most cases  Great feature  You can let the camera take automatically adjusted shots for you  or  you can control the brightness and more with manual settings  I have compared the photos that my Olympus has taken to friend s more expensive digital cameras  A Sony Mavicas and a Fuji  and mine were by far better on screen  and in print This particular model came with a  quot Camedia Floppy Disk Adapter quot  which allows you to insert your Smart Media card into it and use it through your floppy drive to download photos  This is an added plus since the Olympus only includes a serial cable for other types of downloading   a slow process and battery drainer  The floppy adapter can be purchased in stores as a separate item for use with any camera that uses Smart Media cards  by the way Regardless of which 400 series Olympus camera you re thinking about  they re well worth the money  ADDED 12 5 00   SAMPLE PHOTOS I finally got off my butt and did it  Follow the link below  and you ll go to my Yahoo photo page  where you ll find sample photos taken with the Olympus  and a couple of other cameras I ve used  I ll add more photos over time  but there s a few on there now http photos yahoo com greg30127   
Auto, I bought this car because I didn t see very many of them on the road  I was driving a Honda Accord before my SVX  Everyone would stop me and ask me what my car was  It was beautiful  When I took my test drive it was pouring down rain  I did not slip or slide around corners  This car did not lean at all  it was like I was driving on bare pavement  I love the leather and suede interior  This was simply the best car I had ever drove  I was hooked  I loved my car  I bought it in Sept  of 97  I had to replace the starter  and the transmission began to slip in 98  The transmission was replaced  but it took my dealership 2 weeks to get the transmission  Because the SVX is no longer in production  the parts are usually a special order  sometimes from Japan  I have also had to replace some electrical switches  These are very expensive from the dealership  so I have tried to find them at a wrecking yard  I always have a very hard time finding parts  usually have to use a parts locator and even then they are pretty spendy I have drove this car in the snow and couldn t believe the handling  I felt very safe and secure in this car Yesterday  September 19th 2000  a guy ran an intersection as I was traveling 45mph  I had no time to stop  The next thing I know my air bag deployed  and my 3 year old daughter was in the back seat  I always thought if you hit someone head on you would be seriously injured or dead  But I was fine  except for the bumps and bruises  I couldn t believe it  The guy I hit was in a Full size Dodge extra cab pick up  the collision flipped him upside down  He is OK too  The front end collision to my car made the engine drop down  The SVX motor is in sideways and is designed to do this in a front end collision  This car is built so well I had no interior damage  and because of the well contured seats I sustained minimal injures  The firemen said I walked away from this accident because of my air bag  and the way the engine exorbed the damage  My car is totaled  But  it saved me from serious injures  If I was in a car that did not have these features  I would be in the hospital right now  My daughter is ok too  she was just shaken up I would highly recommend this car if you can find one  If you buy one from a dealership I recommend buying the extended warranty  the transmission for my car was  4000 br br  
Auto, I bought the 1995 LS Integra sedan new  After 84 000 highway miles  this car can only be described as a GEM of first class proportions  I highly recommend the 5 speed  as you gain power  control  mileage  and the FUN to drive factor First  I have not had ONE SINGLE THING ever go wrong with the car  It has driven flawlessly from day one  without a single non routine maintenance repair  Other than routine oil changes  and service  I have had NO shop visit  I have done routine maintenance and had one set of front disc pads replaced  To this day  it rides  accelerates  handles  and behaves precisely as well as it did when I drove it off the dealer s lot The LS is a great performer and great fun to drive  Don t believe what you read about how the Integra GSR outperforms the LS  In everyday driving  and even quite challenging driving you won t tell the difference  The fact is  when you overlay the torque power acceleration curves for the 140 HP LS vs  the 170 HP GSR  they are virtually identical until you get well above 5500 RPM s  That s really where the VTEC advantages of the GSR kick in  Now if you are out racing at 100 MPH   on a routine basis  then the several 6 or 7 thousand   more for the GSR will be justified  In everyday routine driving however  even HARD and FAST driving   which is what I do  there simply is no substantive difference I love the handling on this gem  and commute a winding  demanding road  80 miles daily  I simply never get tired of the  quot fun quot  factor that an otherwise torturous drive  produces from this car  Comfort is also a big plus with excellent fit and finish  well laid out dash  strong air conditioner  comfy seats  and excellent visibility  Mileage for all this power and fun  Unbeatable  I consistently get 28 to 34 MPG on 89 octane with this screamer  and I drive it pretty hard  Complaints  None of substance  My only nits to pick would be that interior road noise is slightly higher than more  quot sedate quot  sedans provide  wind noise around door seals is a bit higher than for most sedans  and the stock premium stereo could be better for those into audiophile quality sounds systems  Beyond those rather minor  quot sound quot  related caveats  I have simply never owned a car I loved more than this one  And probably never will again  if they redesign the fun out of this  as so many other manufacturers have done br br  
Camera, When Office Depot offered a free 64MB Smart Media Card with the purchase of the Olympus D 380 camera  I didn t hesitate a minute  Before the day was out  I was the proud owner of this camera  I haven t had a digital camera since I purchased a Toshiba M 4 last year  Unfortunately  the newer versions of the M 4 didn t come with a serial cable  and I resisted buying one for the outrageous price of  45 until it was too late  they discontinued offering it  I got rid of the M 4  Last week I finally bit the bullet and upgraded my Windows 95 to Windows 98SE  which then activated my USB port  I now felt that I could purchase almost any digital camera and be able to transfer pictures to my computer   Yeah  right i I read all the instructions that came with the D 380 and took a few sample pictures  The camera was very easy to use  and the only thing I disliked was that the camera was too small to hold comfortably  I imagine that one could easily get used to the small size b The Good  This camera takes great pictures  It is point and shoot  for the most part  It boasts 2 0 megapixels  a focus free glass lens  4 5mm  f4  and can take short movies  It produces up to 1600x1208 pixel images  The camera weighs in at 6 7 ounces and is 4 9 x2 56 x1 6  in size  Because it is small  it can fit in a pocket or purse  The lens cover is permanently attached to the front of the camera  When you slide the lens cover off the lens  the camera automatically turns on  and when you slide the cover back over the lens  the camera turns off The D 380 uses removable Smart Media cards  but also has 1MB of internal memory as a back up  You can change the resolution of pictures while they are still in the camera  You can merge photos to produce panorama shots  There is a built in flash with 6 modes and red eye reduction  The camera comes with a USB cable  wrist strap  instruction manual  and warranty card b The Not So Good  The D 380 comes with only an 8MB Smart Media card Unfortunately  there is no optical zoom  but there is a 2 5 digital zoom The camera runs on 4 AA alkaline batteries  which are included  It does  not  come equipped with rechargeable batteries or a battery charger  Any AA batteries may be used except manganese batteries b The Ugly  The camera arrived with Camedia Master Software 4 0 for management of your pictures  In all the large print  it claims that this software is compatible with Windows 98SE  Alas  if you get down to the very small print  you will see that there are about four operating systems that will not work with this software  Windows 98SE  Upgrade  is one of these exceptions I will admit that I saw this warning before I installed the software  but all my life I have been a daredevil  throwing caution to the winds  This time was no exception  The software loaded without any problems  and I was able to download a picture from the camera via the USB port  The quality of the picture was excellent  Hurray  I thought I was beating the odds yet another time  That was before I decided to move the picture to my Paper Port archives  When I clicked on my Paper Port  where  all  of my photos are located  I got the following error messages   A device attached to the system is not functioning  and  The SHELL32 DLL file is linked to missing export SHLWAPI DLL SHRegGetUSValueA Well  I thought  perhaps I just might delete the SHLWAPI file  and all would be well  However  when I took a look at the SHLWAPI file  oh my  it had so much unreadable stuff in it that I quickly gave up that idea Even after I uninstalled the Camedia software  I could not access Paper Port and gain access to my photo archives  Now I have to  once again  re format my computer from square one  I am getting pretty good at that So  back I went to Office Depot and reluctantly returned that nifty little camera  Sigh  
Camera, Since purchasing my Sony MVC FD92 digital camera  I have only used a regular camera maybe twice  I still have a roll of film in it that I need to finish This camera is   easy b  to use  I was taking pictures and video within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box  I cannot recall a purchase that I have been happier with The only thing that I do not like about it  is how it takes the picture  You click the button  it flashes and then takes the picture  My toddler doesn t stand sit still that long  but it is making me a better amateur photographer This camera uses both the Memory Stick technology AND 3 1 2 inch floppy discs   Both sold separately  I have not seen how many files I can get on a 32MB memory stick yet  but I have had 40 on the stick and still had more room It comes with a USB adapter so you can hook it up to your computer and download the pictures  Or you can copy from your memory stick to your floppy and just stick the floppy in your computer  The latter is a little more cumbersome  but works great when your computer doesn t have a USB port There is a color LCD display to view what you are taking and to do a play back  You can delete pictures that you do not like while they are still on the camera  No more wasting money on processing pictures with someone s eyes closed or when they have turned their head on you There are 3 4 settings that you can use to take your pictures also  There is normal  black and white  sepia and I think one more  I have not tried any of these settings yet  I have only had my camera a couple of months With the digital camera  you can either upload your pictures to a number of online photo places for printing or  depending on the printer you have  print them yourself  The latter is the option I choose  The only way people can tell that I have printed them myself is if they touch them  I use regular ink jet paper  but they turn out fabulous I bought this camera because I wanted to be able to share pictures and little videos of my child  and any children to come  with family members who don t live near us  And being an employee of Sony  I get a discount   6 20 01   Update  I have found one other thing that I do not particularly like about this camera  The 5 second videos only look good when viewed on the camera itself  I have a little video of my son and a new monitor  I can make out his features  but not very well  
Auto, I found the deal of the century two years ago  when I bought my red 94 Turbo with only 12000 miles on it  I have since driven form Minnesota to Arizona three times  What a car  It is extremely fast  but also very roomy and comfortable  The sport roof is a must  especially in warm climates like sunny Arizona  There are few things not to love about this car  How many cars are there out there that can go 0 60 in five seconds under forty grand  No matter where I drive  even on ritzy Rodeo Drive last summer  I was getting looks  It is a very flashy car with that huge spoiler  for a young single guy like myself it is perfect  There is no room in the back except for maybe a couple of kids  Driving the Supra is much easier than many people think the six speed is easy to shift  with very short throws  It makes accelerating fun at every stoplight  The handling is very tight and the turning radius short  even shorter if you kick out the back end  Maybe the only bad thing  is driving in bad weather  As in any powerful sports car care must be given when shifting on wet roads  I have had some scary experiences  Overall it is the best car ever produced by Toyota in my book  and since there are no more in production  you better get your hands on one now if you can br br  
Camera, Digital cameras are very much like computers by now  wait six months and you brand new camera will be topped and out featured by the new release  But much like my computer  I want something that works well  is dependable  and gives me what I need  In this case  I want an easy and convenient camera that takes good pictures  The Olympus D 490 Zoom is ideal because not only does it give me what I want  but it didn t cost a ridiculous amount as well First and foremost I should mention a couple of elements that are always talked about when addressing digital cameras and that I needed to keep in mind while shopping around  Said elements are megapixels and storage Megapixels  By now  digital cameras are coming out with 4  megapixel cameras for around  1000 dollars  I m sure in 5 years they ll be  300  just like 2 megapixel cameras went through not so long ago   Megapixels  are essentially the number of pixels that make up your pictures  and the higher the number of megapixels  the more fine detailed your pictures are  1 megapixel cameras are the flashbulb wind up cameras of the 21st century to your average store clerk by now  and though I d like to think the 2 1 Olympus D 490 Zoom isn t yet  it probably will be in no time  BUT unless you re a forensics detective charged with analyzing evidence photos  the 2 1 megapixels crank out huge  gorgeous pictures that will suit any occasion  I ve seen higher quality cameras  results and yes  they are better  but only in the same way platinum is  better  than gold Storage  There s different ways to save your pictures in memory to place on your computer  Some take regular 3 5 inch floppy discs  Sonys take their special memory sticks  and several take SanDisk s SmartMedia cards which are a little smaller than two postage stamps yet store a LOT more than the floppy kind and are much more common than Sony s specialized memory storage system  The D 490 Zoom comes with an 8M card and you can purchase larger ones for a semi expensive price  but keep in mind  for this and all purchases concerning this camera  that if you count enough pictures  you WILL end up saving money if you consider all film and developing purchases you won t ever bother with again Incidentally  for more information concerning both of these slightly tricky elements and several others you really should give thought to before buying a digital camera  seek more information on the  net  or what I did  which is study the large article in a semi recent Consumer Reports magazine that greatly helped me out As for the camera itself  I ve been very happy with it  It does crank out high quality pictures  You can use the typical view finder  which saves power  or the screen built into the back  It has a convenient flash with several options  anti red eye  long distance for darkened scenery  even  long distance anti red eye  I can scan all pictures as soon as I take them  take multiple shots if I think one hasn t come out well and delete any that didn t  and best of all can take countless stupid  innane  and goofy pictures that I normally would ve never  wasted film on  It has a nifty little zoom that can also be set to digital though to be frank I ve heard negative things about digital zoom so it s at the end of the list of things I ve yet to learn about the camera  And that leads me to one of the only drawbacks With so many options comes a rather complicated on screen menu  And it displays on menu while the camera s on and another when off which can be confusing  But my opinion is that you have to take the bad with the good  you could have less complex menus with a camera that has less functionality  While pointing out the negatives  the D 490 Zoom does not include an AC adapter  nor does it have a USB connector  Also  regular AA batteries aren t supposed to be used with it  there s a special kind designed for high end electronics which I didn t know until I had already purchased it  Finally  the only way to turn off the camera is to close the sliding door but it s dangerously close to the telescoping lens which makes me wonder if they could have designed it a bit better  Otherwise  I m completely out of  Cons  but I m being purposefully critical Finally  I AM a big believer that this camera will pay for itself after I take enough pictures with it  I  splurged  on this purchase  buying the camera on sale but also buying special rechargable batteries made for digital cameras  the recharger  and a  FlashPath  SanDisk floppy disk adapter to make transferring the pictures from camera to computer infinitely easier   That s the next critique I ll crank out  All together it cost me around  650  I figure that after 1000 pictures the camera will have paid for itself  I ve only had it for less than two months  and it s already 1 5th of the way there Considering everything  the Olympus D 490 Zoom is a great product  It s dependable  solidly built  offers loads of functions and fun to use  It deserves a solid four stars and definite consideration if you re thinking of buying a digital camera  And for the freedom and fun digital cameras offer  the entire concept deserves a gleaming five stars  
Camera,   Describe your experience using this product When I use this camera it is mainly to take pictures of my friends and special lifetime events that go on like going to parties or other fun functions  I use it completely in lieu of a normal 35 mm camera and it operates just as easily  I think its great because on the little screen in the back you can tell if you blinked in the picture  and if you did immediately retake the picture so you dont have to wait to get the film developed to find out that the picture was horrible because you blinked or put your head in a weird position and got a double chin etc  It is great for that purpose  When I try to take pictures of my dogs with it though  is where I found that it isnt so great they arent the most patient of subjects  They often will not hold the pose as long as a human so the picture is all a matter of luck    Why did you buy this product I got the camera as a gift for graduating from college so I could document my travels after graduation  It is perfect for that  I took it with me everywhere and have great quality pictures from everywhere I went  It was lightweight and easy to carry around with me everywhere so I didnt worry about it at all  In fact  I had it in my small purse and didnt even remember most of the time because it was so lightweight    What do you love about this product Obviously so far you can tell that I love the picture quality  and the lightweight and ease of use  The camera is great for amateur photography  or just documenting your life    What do you hate What I dont like about the camera is that I have had it for a short amount of time and have had to buy the batteries for it 4 times already  Of course some were completely my fault like for leaving it plugged into my computer overnight so it drained the batteries keeping itself awake  or when it opened the slide front when I didnt have it in a bag in my purse so the camera was just sitting there waiting to take pictures but just the same it is irritating because the local radio shack doesnt carry the batteries in stock so I have to order them The other thing I dont like is the inability to zoom into things really far away  One night  I saw a picture of the moon that was absolutely amazing and wanted to take a picture of it to use as my background on my monitor  I took the picture and got it home only to realize that all I had was really sky  the moon was so tiny that you couldnt even tell it was really there  
Auto, When the gas prices went way up in the spring  it was time to trade in my beloved Chevy truck and find something that was better on gas  I have a favorite dealership so I tried to find a car on their lot  After driving a few different cars  I settled on the 1998 Saturn SL that was on their lot  Needless to say  I love it  We have a family car but my Saturn is the car I drive to and from work  Work is 17 miles each way so I needed something that was great on gas mileage  Driving around town only  the car gets at least 30 miles per gallon  That s my kind of car This is the first Saturn I have ever owned and I will look for another one when it s time  This car was used with 44 000 miles on it  I haven t had it in the shop yet and it runs great  I change the oil faithfully every 2500 3000 miles  The car is a 5 speed so I suppose that helps a little on the gas mileage  I have a few kids and they ride comfortably in the backseat when we take the car anywhere  We don t take the car on trips because there isn t a whole lot of room but it s great for short distances Well  what else can I say about this little car  The trunk is huge  it shifts easily and has alot of spunk  And the price was reasonable and fit into my budget br br  
Auto, Our 1996 Dodge Neon  bought new  now with 55 000 miles  has been a great value  Economical to buy  economical to operate  44 mpg highway  32 34 mpg city  reliable  We bought our Neon because the selling price  9100  was low  It has never failed us  It always starts right up  even in sub zero weather  It is easy to maintain  I do my own oil changes  It handles reasonably well at all speeds  Only a couple of things that I don t like  The  96 does not have full frame doors  and one door has developed a rattle  The left windshield wiper is larger than the right windshield wiper  so that replacing them requires a purchase of two different sized refills  These are minor problems  I would definitely buy another Neon and recommend the Neon to anybody seeking excellent value br br  
Auto, Hi  I m Peter and I am a car enthusiast  I have read about this car and driven it a lot despite the fact that I still don t own one  What is great about this car is that it is the most reliable car on the road in my opinion  Mercedes has always been known as a reliable car company but they took it a step further when they created this sleek new E class  Another great aspect about this car is that it is also safe  It has the side airbags and head curtains for added safety  When I was looking into the cars in this price range  I was stuck between getting the BMW 5 series and this E class  I really liked the power and luxury of the BMW but I also liked how the Mercedes drove  Each of these cars are excellent but what struck me to be strange was how much more spartan the Mercedes was than the BMW  I could easily tell that Mercedes put all of their energy into making this car from the engine and body out  while the BMW focused more on the interior comfort  I know that when you go yo look at this car  you will see the  40 000  price tag and think that it is too expensive  Don t  whatever you do  look at this car as just a car  This is an investment  What I suggest to do is to get the most out of this car  If you opt for an E 300  was not made in 2000 but will be back in 2001 or 2002  you will get a much better value  This car will last as long as you  You can buy it when you are 16 and drive it when you re 50  Just think of how many times you would have to buy a new car if you consistently bought a ford focus  Also  this car with the deisel engine has a great gas mileage  For these reasons  get an E 300 diesel and save money on your next car br br  
Auto, I have to be honest with you   perhaps I m biased  but I ve always been a Mercedes girl  From my dad s first 240D to his 380 SL  I was in heaven He s just turned in his SUV and was on the prowl for something fun  fast and preferably a convertible  We looked at everything from a Porsche Boxter  Audi s  BMW s  Saabs and beyond  As a last resort  dad headed out to the Mercedes dealer  Though he d always been in love with Mercedes  he didn t think this car was the answer To say that joy shone from his face the first time he drove it was an understatement  He had found his nirvana It came in the form of a silver 2001 Mercedes SLK380 I had been with him in his vehicle pursuit  We d tried everything  I found the Boxter fun  but we lost out on that one  I thought the BMW s were very disappointing  We tried a 6 speed and an automatic and both lacked any of the power or pizazz I had expected  The Saab s were nice  but a little too family oriented  This Mercedes was the first two seater I had actually found COMFY  The seats hug your back no matter what size you may be  There is an amazing amount of leg room  I m 5 10  which is always a requirement in any car I either drive or sit as a passenger The controls were a little hard to decipher at first passing glance  but the little flip chart they provide with the car answers any and all questions I find it interesting that they sell the CD Changer as an option  And of course the car can only have the Mercedes changer  Nothing like protecting their interests  But the addition of the changer was a good choice The hardtop is a great thing  The prior 380SL we owned had the detachable hardtop which was  to say the least  cumbersome and difficult to store  The hardtop provides great durability  no replacing the top on this car  and gives a sleeker line than some other convertibles in it s class An amazing option that I had never heard of before was the automatic transmission that could also be driven as a 5 speed  I m not any sort of expert on cars  so pardon me while I still wipe the look of  Wow  I didn t know they could do that  off my face  It s a nice option as you can choose the kind of drive you want I found the drive solid and stable  It hugged the curves and flew down any straightaways  The only few drawbacks are as follow 1  When the top is down  you can almost completely forget about the trunk  Sure  you could fit a few bags in there  but don t expect to throw the top down while on a cross country journey  Unless  of course  you pack light 2  The netting behind the drivers head can cause some sight impairment while backing up with the top down  And it s a pain to take it off and put it back on later  Overall for the price tag  I found this car to be the best value in it s class  It s sporty  it s elegant and it s classy  Plus it comes with a great warranty and gets decent mileage  
Camera, I bought this camera as an impulse purchase  but unlike most such purchases I have no regrets  It takes the best pictures I ve seen from a moderately priced camera  and I can t believe the detail I get in night shots  I took pictures of the last lunar eclipse  and I was able to zoom right in and get all the details  even the clouds near it  It has a low battery life  and I would strongly recomend buying a battery charger and 8 rechargeable batteries making the only negative feature a positive     
Auto, I purchased my 1991 Accord used a year ago this past April  This is my fourth Honda product  I purchased all the others with well over 100 000 miles on them and they all ran flawlessly  and I got each of them to over 200 000 before selling not scrapping them  This specimen had 121 000 on it then and is pushing 155 000 now  I snapped it up right away because it was the only Accord Wagon I d ever seen with a 5 speed  despite a few character flaws I attribute to previous owner bone headedness  such as a broken antenna  cheesily tinted windows  and rusty rear quarters  a flaw common to all older Hondas but easily preventable with periodic inspection and clearing of the rear fender drains  I am a musician and I have loaded my Accord to the gills with  heavy  musical gear  It has never complained and  even loaded down  will return 25 mpg  It handles great  and  with a 5 speed  is surprisingly quick  I have had my share of fun dusting the occasional slammed import or Focus and enjoyed immensely the look on the driver s face as he she watches my rear bumper bounce up and down between shifts  The interior is likewise mint  with the exception of a Pioneer head unit and CD changer  I have replaced the power antenna but will soon need a new one my fault  not the car s  Also  I have retrofitted a set of Accord EX six spoke alloys  What I have ended up with  I feel  is a remarkably well built  slick looking  but not ostentatious  efficient little hauler that can scoot pretty well when you ask it to  If you can find one with a manual  they re out there  but rare  I say go for it  Even in general  I cannot recommend the Accord wagon enough  I d buy another one in a second  Don t think I ll need to for a while  though  
Camera, After taking the time to  really learn my camera  I am thrilled with it  I m guessing I m not the only one that went from a nice  point and shoot  35 mm camera to a digital  I received mine as a Holiday gift or perhaps I would have realized I was buying something beyond my  expertise  Forget the manual  I had better luck with third party books  specifically  So you bought a digital camera  Now what    sold at Barnes  Noble  Sony really needs to support the buyer with a full fledged operating manual for both the camera AND the accompanying pared down version of software that you get  that allows you to  use the photographs That said  my only other gripe would be the delay the  focus  feature causes in getting action shots  I always thought that holding down the shutter part way  froze the action  but now realize the camera is only freezing the  focus  and IF you follow through and take the shot  it won t be the image you saw  frozen  in the display  but a second or two  later  You can always use the  movie  setting to record action  but you can t extract individual frames  as would  seem possible The quality of what you DO get is amazing I love to be able to change the photo from it s original color to sepia or to black in white right on the camera without affecting the  original photo The  movie  mode has been a great way to preserve family snippets in sizes easily e mailed The battery life is incredible  I have always had the battery to do what I wanted  Something that almost never happens with our Sony video camera  The viewfinder comes in real handy when bright outside light renders the LCD screen invisible and it can be adjusted for those of you that wear glasses I use my camera just about every day and I am always happening upon  new features  new to  me anyways  I may have been pleased with a less expensive camera option  but I truly can t imagine being without digital now  
Camera, We needed a digital camera for construction site photos at work  so knowing I m a gadget and camera freak  they assigned me to be the buyer of a digital camera  I found the C 211 at a clearance sale for  135 00  Here s my opinion b  What You Get   Intro   The Olympus C 211 comes with a large set of multi lingual instruction manuals  and a quick start guide  Well written  and hard to come across in this day where more and more camera makers are putting their manual on C D  disks  You of course get the C 211 camera  a neck strap and len s cap  a USB cable for photo downloading  a video cable for viewing photos on a television  a pack of Polaroid 500 film  and an 8 meg Smart Media memory card  as you can guess  you ll want to buy a larger card  as you ll only get about 5 images on an 8 meg card at the camera s fine setting  A set of AA batteries and software C D  top off the list of in the box goods b  The Good   In Olympus tradition  photo quality is very good  showing lots of detail and nice  if perhaps a bit subdued  colors  With a top resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels  2 megapixel  you ll be able to print excellent 5 x 7 photos  and some pretty nice 8 x 10 photos  too  On my H P  printer using photo paper  the photos were great  but using the self serv lab printer at my local Walgreens  the photos were outstanding  These self serve printers can be found at Wal mart  CVS  and Eckerd drug stores  too You can of course  set the camera for a lower 640 x 480 pixel size  and use these photos for email or web pages  There are two  quality  settings at this lower size  and on screen even they look very nice  with lots of details  though they will not look very good via your printer  You can however  use the C 211 s built in Polaroid printer to print even these lower resolution photos with decent results  since the Polaroids are only 2 x 3 inches in size  I found the Polaroid prints to be decent in quality   I ve seen better from an inkjet printer of course  but they re a bit better than prints from an actual Polaroid camera  In the camera s settings you can adjust the printed photos contrast and brightness  to some degree  Besides the two pixel sizes of photos  you can adjust quality settings as well  Either standard quality  SQ  for web use  high quality  HQ  for everyday photos  super high quality  SHQ  for prints  and TIFF mode  no compression  for even more detailed larger prints  Be aware that TIFF prints require tons of space on a memory card  so use sparingly  and only if you really want a good 8 x 10 print The lens is a 3 X optical zoom  good  with a digital zoom option  which I avoid as digital zooms always degrade an image s quality  The lens is threaded  so you can screw on 35 5mm sized filters  a BIG plus to me  since many digital cameras still do not have this ability without adding awkward adapters to the lens  I recommend getting a cheap UV filter right off the bat  to protect the main lens  Your lens cap will still clip on to the front of the filter  35 5mm is a somewhat awkward size  but you can find them in limited supplies at Ritz Camera stores  only through special order at Wolf Camera  however The menu and control buttons are arranged nicely on the back of the camera  next to the color LCD display  The zoom control is via a toggle type lever that surrounds the control buttons  easily reachable with your thumb  The menu button scrolls you through the camera s various settings  including setting up the camera for the 15 second  video  mode  352 pixels in size  photo quality modes  and more  A larger  Print  button allows you to print the photo you re viewing on the LCD screen via the built in printer  Push it  and poof  out pops a Polaroid that develops fully in about 5 minutes b  The Bad   The C 211 uses 4  AA sized batteries  Anyone who has used digital cameras before though  knows that off the shelf alkaline batteries are eaten like candy by these things  and I found that alkalines have an extremely short life in the C 211  Since there is no optical viewfinder on this camera  you must rely on the color LCD to be on at all times to compose your photos  and since the LCD is the largest battery draining part of a camera  this contributes to short battery life  15 20 shots  max  Trying some rechargeable NiMh batteries  my results were a bit better  Maybe 50 photos using the LCD  zoom  and flash  on about one fifth of the shots  Note you can use a USB memory  Smart Media  card reader to download your photos into the computer instead of the camera s USB cable  to conserve battery power  The LCD is as on most digital cameras  hard to see outdoors in bright sunlight  There is a flap that opens above for daylight use  that improves visibility somewhat  but just be prepared to  squint  a bit in sunlight  when composing photos  An anti glare coating on the LCD s glass would have helped  Size DOES matter when it comes to carrying about a digital camera all day  and here  the C 211 is a whopper  Roughly 9 inches tall and thick to accommodate the printer  it s big by any camera s terms  and the included neck strap is definitely needed  You will not carry this in one hand all day at the zoo  I m not sure I should list this as a  bad  thing  as again  there s simply no way they could have included a printer without the camera being this size  but if you re looking for a  carry around  digital camera  this would be a liability b  Extras   The manual suggests that a 64 meg Smart Media card is the largest size card you can use for this camera  but I have a 128 meg card in ours  and it works fine  With the camera set at 1600 x 1200 pixels  and  SHQ  I can take roughly 90 photos with such a large card  Cards are cheap now  so stock up so you don t run out of pixel power b  Finals   In terms of digital image quality  I give the C 211 a large  thumbs up  The Polaroid prints I give a  decent  grade too in quality  they have muted colors and can be a bit grainy  but again  they re better than standard Polaroid camera prints usually are  In terms of size however  I have to say that I would recommend this camera more for  field use  by people in the construction field  police  fire  insurance  or real estate agents  as opposed to the casual snap shooter who wants to carry a camera to outings and gatherings  For less money  you can still find an Olympus D 490  which is essentially the same camera minus the built in printer  and is much smaller If you do need a printer camera however  the C 211 is a good one to have  Look for bargains  too  Some stores are still trying to get  599 for this thing  and I have seen them on sale for as little as  135 00  clearance  to  249 00  occasional Office Max sales  so shop around  and happy snapping

Auto, Ready or not it s soccer mom time  Right after the birth of our son we traded in my truck for this 1996 caravan  Mentally not ready to be a  quot soccer mom quot  I reluctantly gave in and agreed to get it  Other than the mental thing I loved it  At first  It ran great  had get up and go power  and was spacious enough for everything and everybody  Then we smelled gas  Every time we filled it up it would reek of gas  Upon looking under the van we saw the drip drip drip  The van has an open recall to replace fuel tank O ring seal  It also has a recall to replace the fan relay  The only other  bugs  I have found with this van are something is alive in the windshield wipers  They turn on at their own will and sometimes I can t get them to turn off  If driving for long periods of time without stopping it will sometimes die when you slow down to turn or when you come to a complete stop  And the breaks get hot easy and make a grinding sound  Have taken it in to have them looked at and was told they are fine but that they get hot and make that sound  It handles nice and is a smooth ride  It has plenty of room for everything you may need  The heater and A C work really great  Loved the amount of cup holders  Seats are easy to remove but quite heavy once you get them out  All and all this is a good vehicle for those that are ready to get a mini van  I never really want it  there for I never really liked it     
Auto, This is the BMW Z3M This car is fast My girlfriends father bought this car about 1 month ago  It doesn t look a whole lot different than a normal Z3  Same shape  same color schemes  same eye catching design but after all that s just looks The Z3M is a 3 2 liter 240 HP version of it s wimpy little brother  It will take you up to legal speeds before you know it  and it will ultimately result in a speeding ticket if you re not careful  You ll undoubtably pass other Z3 s on the highway laugh at them I did  The Z3M as I consider it has no relation other than looks to a typical Z3  The engine is far bigger than the first Z3 s  the brakes and handling are definitely M Class and it weighs more on performance than image This car is easy to abuse  it just begs to be redlined  although I wouldn t recommend it  and loves to be driven carefree  and hates traffic  Enough about the car and it s feelings  let s talk about looks  I ve heard the words  quot Shark quot  and  quot European Muscle Car quot  but someone summed it up best when they said  quot damn quot  It s looks  tight cockpit  clustered dash  and all the pertinent instruments in the right place make for a near perfect ergonomic setup I have to add that my only complaint is the non adjustable steering wheel column  Aside from this minor flaw the BMW is an overall best buy in the inexpensive sports car category  If you can afford the upgrade from a mediocre performing Z3 you can pick one up if your lucky enough to find one for around  44 000 US  If you don t have the money take my advice don t drive it  It s not worth the flashbacks of  quot it was almost mine  if I only had the money quot  10 years down the road br br  
Auto, Me and my family love corvettes  On the day I was born my dad ordered a Corvette and I was the first to sit in it when I was 4 months old  My grandfather started a garage many years ago and they specialize in Corvettes  They are excellent performance vehicles and I highly recommend them  If you have a chance to visit the Corvette Factory in Bowling Green  Kentucky I would highly recommend it  When I went several years ago we saw Rick Mears  car being built  he is a race car driver  Corvettes aren t very practical and we do not drive them in the rain or snow but they are the best American sports car br br  
Auto, We bought this van because we needed more room for a growing family  This van seemed to have more space than the other types that were on the market  We test drove pretty much all makes and settled on this one This van handles very well in the snow  The anti lock brakes and front wheel drive are major pluses on this vehicle  It also handles well in the city and on the interstate  I think it is also easy to park I was not crazy about the warranty  A 3 year 30 000 mile warranty is not much  I also believe that you shouldn t have to buy an extended warranty on a new vehicle  This year with it being 4 years old  we have had to replace the condenser on the air conditioning  We have also had to have new brakes put on  This is a low mileage vehicle  I did not feel that it is holding up well  I think anyone with a good sized family might consider looking at one of these vans  I would check the repair history on it before purchasing br br  
Auto, I bought my Saturn SC because my old car was falling apart  I wanted something economic and reliable after having been through reliability hell with Ford  I visited all affordable dealers  Chev  Pontiac  VW  Nissan  etc  But when I laid eyes on the Saturn  I fell in love They couldn t have chosen a better red  And with the aluminium wheels  I had shivers Imagine walking to your car everyday  your pulse accelerating at the thought of driving this beauty  What I love most about this car  obviously  is its appearance  The styling  especially the front  is SUPERB  As far as looks are concerned  I place my Saturn on par with any Porsche 911 The SC is very agile and light  Under the hood  everything is within easy reach and uncluttered  You could say it s very user friendly  wether you re an expert or only know how to add windshield washer fluid I ve always had excellent service from my dealer  Without fault They treated me like a human  not a bank account There is nothing I hate about this car  There is very little bad to say about it  Here are my two points worth noting    The SOHC does have somewhat low power  but quite sufficient to have an exciting drive anywhere but the autobahn  The DOHC is GREAT  The seats could use more padding  The shape is fine  but they aren t cushy enough  However  even being 6  tall  there s room for my legs I would recommend this car to anyone it suits   not a family of six I have driven many cars  and I can assure you that I will not hesitate to buy a new Saturn SC when my lease is up  Enjoy br br  
Auto, We own a 1998 Saturn LS  and are leasing a Mercury Sable  When we turn the Sable in  in August  we are leasing another Saturn We have not had any problems with the Saturn  except for the keypad for the alarm not working  Saturn came to where my car was with a new battery for the keypad and made sure I was off and on my way before they left  The only complaint I have about the car is the back seat is cramped and you sit up at an angle  luckily I don t have to set back there   my kids do and they don t mind  The trunk is very roomy and you can easily put odd sized boxes in the trunk   there is no lip on the trunk  the trunk hood is  quot L quot  shaped so the lip is in the hood  We have a factory installed CD Player in our car and there have not been any problems with that   it plays smoothly  even when you hit bumps  The window controls are in the center console and take a bit of getting used to  but after opening and closing them a few times it s not a problem  This car has daytime running lights  which give you a discount on your auto insurance  and it has a factor installed alarm  another discount    Make sure you tell your insurance company about these features  We are getting about 26 MPG locally and about 35 on the highway  another important feature with todays gas prices We bring our car in regularly  every 3 months  for an oil change and whatever the scheduled maintenance is on the car at the time  rotate tires  3 000 mile checkup  etc The service department is wonderful and is the main reason for me wanting another Saturn   Plus they wash your car each time you bring it in for service  I have had to deal with service departments for other car dealerships and Saturn is the only one where I have felt comfortable They are truly a different kind of car and a different kind of people  I have not met one unpleasant employee at Saturn whether it be in service  sales  or just speaking to the Saturn Receptionist on the phone  I highly recommend them   my next car is the Saturn Stationwagon br br  
Camera, I thought I had found the perfect 4 megapixel camera  Perhaps not I came to the A80 as the proud owner of Canon s EOS Rebel 35mm camera  which is a workhorse piece of photography equipment and very  very highly recommended  Canon knows photography  and the brand s popularity is  in my estimation  justly deserved  The A80 promises the convenience of a point and shoot as well as much of the flexibility of an SLR  with excellent performance in either case  and at an exceptional price point  The user takes as little or as much control of the photo making process as he she prefers  and the results are extremely satisfying Generally  I think the promise is largely fulfilled  All of the familiar photo taking modes from fully automatic  to portrait  to sports  to night  to panoramic  to fully manual  to aperture control  etc are represented here  in addition to two user preset modes for storing your preferred settings  There is  as above  tremendous opportunity for flexibility  auto white balance  or manual  control of flash intensity  control of ISO setting  a automatic multi focus  defeatable  the ability to add attachment lenses  etc and so on  all of which is well documented in other reviews  not to mention in the serviceable  if somewhat lean  instruction manual  The camera s start up time is quick and the average user will fire up the A80 and be taking very good photos in no time Overall  image quality is superb  even at modest resolution settings  At the best resolution  images are stunningly precise and seem to have very natural color balance  options exist for shooting in enhanced color  black and white and sepia as well  Purple fringing is a non issue for me  although I can see it  it doesn t bother me  Results in indoor without a flash  a potentially tricky situation  can be very  very good with the proper mode selection and tweaking  and outdoor results in daylight are about as good as it gets  Shooting performance is very good  with very acceptable shuttler lag  quick camera start up time  and decent  3X  optical zoom capability  Battery consumption is quite conservative  and you will get hundreds of exposures from a single charge of 4AA rechargeables The included software works  but I like the simplicity of XP s camera manager  The movie mode works  but at a limited resolution compared with other models  including Canon s little brother  the A70  which has a VGA movie mode  this feature is fun  but nothing more in my estimation My problems with the camera center around ergonomics  I still haven t found a use for the flip screen other than flipping it back into the camera so that the LCD is protected  I m somewhat concerned about the long term durability of the mechanism that allows for screen rotation and flipping  And  as has been mentioned elsewhere  the LCD is simply too small  Readable  yes  Sufficient in resolution  probably  Too small  absolutely  The placement of the slider that toggles between shooting and playback modes is OK  but the actual slider itself feels flimsy and cheap  and I also worry about its durability  the A70 seems to have a superior switch for this function  I m also not thrilled with the placement of the zoom control  and probably would have preferred it on the rear of the camera  Finally  a diopter correcting knob for the viewfinder is a must in a camera like this There s a lot to like here  and it s hard to argue with the shooting performance of this camera  Unfortunately  the engineering isn t quite what it ought to be  and I m considering moving to another model  A camera with this much shooting prowess ought to have a better LCD and better review controls  
Camera,  Sony Mavica takes CD R technology on the road  I ve been a Nikon disciple for over 10 years  but the new CD capable Sony Mavica lured me away from the digital Coolpix series  While planning a trip to Europe  I decided my venerable Nikon CP 900 just wasn t up to the vacation photo task anymore  I wanted more control than the 900 could offer  precise aperture and shutter priorities  manual focusing  finer EV compensation  and external flash options The two latest Nikon offerings  the CP 990 and the professional D1 both fit the bill  We d all be using the D1 if we could afford it  but after consulting the checkbook  my considerations came down to either updating my Nikon or braving the waters on a first generation product with the new Sony Mavica CD 1000  The destination for my digital work is primarily the web  so the difference between a 2 or 3 megapixel camera is negligible  If my final product is a print  there is still no substitute for film b Much better image quality than previous Mavicas  In the past  I ve been a snob for the  quot Nikkor glass quot  and that influenced my decision in the digital format as well  With the previous generations of Mavicas  the floppy file size limitation put the image quality far below my standards  nevermind the quality of the glass  With a firm step forward  Sony has broken through that barrier by exchanging the floppies for CDs  increasing the capacity a hundredfold  Now that the new Mavica isn t crippled by disk size  the real quality of the photos can be seen without the overbearing JPG compression  While based on the same body and electronics  the CD 1000 s normal file size is three times larger than it s sister Mavica FD 95  that means less lossy compression and cleaner originals  There s even the option to write totally uncompressed TIFFs  and this is the one camera that has the storage capacity to do it The new CD 1000 covered most of my wishlist  giving me much more manual control than the previous 900 I was used to  I m still waiting for the day when I can match my favorite glass to a digital CCD  but until then  this new Sony will fit the bill  The new Mavica offers one important advantage over the Nikon as a vacation camera  while traveling abroad  the CD R capable Mavica has unchained me from the laptop  Instead of the hourly chore of moving all the images to a hard drive to clear up room  I can now simply swap in a new disc   6 for a pack of 5  each one holds 170 full resolution images b Still camera in camcorder clothing  The most unsuspecting feature I ve found is the brilliant image stabilization technology  While using the long 10x telephoto or the macro mode  this jitter reducing feature really gives you a tack sharp photo even with less than steady hands  You can now forget the tripod for quick macro shots  This still camera acts more like a modified video unit than a traditional SLR  and borrows heavily from Sony s camcorder expertise  It has a comfortable SLR feel with an ergonomic grip  in one way I admire the larger  more traditional pro sumer look  but I also miss the stealth possible from the small rotating Coolpix body  Add on the external flash  bracket  and a Lumiquest  and this Mavica will let you mix slyly in with any pro photographers  My standard film gear includes Nikon F3s and old heavy lenses  so the bulkiness and weight isn t a detraction to me  but be warned that this is one of the largest digicams you re likely to lift The lens paired with the CD 1000 is a 10x monster that gives you the 35mm equivalent of 39 390mm  For my shooting style  I d much rather have something on the wider end and less telephoto  Necessary accessories include the wide angle adapter  50  and external flash unit  100  Luckily  this camera frees you from the Coolpix necessary accessories of batteries  charger  and a card reader  The Mavica includes Sony s smart Lithium Ion battery technology which recharges inside of the camera and also communicates with the body to let you know exactly how many minutes of life it has left  The battery recharges in 3 to 4 hours  lasts over two hours with LCD  and extras are  50 each  Another unique feature of the Sony is dual LCD screens  a decent one on the back and another inside the viewfinder  Turning off the larger one saves battery power  and having the smaller one allows you to shoot just like an SLR b Great piece but too expensive  Of course there are downsides with any first generation product  The durability of a portable CD writing mechanism is often questioned  but this Mavica has performed flawlessly so far  even while trying to make the laser skip when writing  This delay while the CD records brings up the biggest frustration with the new Mavica  The wait from pressing the shutter to the next available frame is still far too long  I understand this is a limit of the technology  but why not use a simple RAM buffer to allow a series of 5 photos before having to write to the disc  The delay actually isn t as bad as I expected  often between 3 and 4 seconds  about the same as my old Nikon which was simply writing to a SmartMedia card  Despite the long reaching telephoto and image stabilization  this camera is not capable of high level sports photography  Anything above little league  and the action will be too fast for the camera to handle   Of course  this can be said about any digital camera currently under  5000  The manual focusing ring is too small and not precise enough for quick follow focusing skills  While a digicam with manual focus might interest those wanting more control  trying to focus the small grainy LCD is nothing like using a bright SLR viewfinder The Mavica CD 1000 isn t the perfect digicam  but it may be the best yet in combining quality imaging with ease of use while still allowing enough manual adjustment for the pro in all of us  It is currently overpriced  you pay a  300 premium for the CD capability over the sister Mavica  but should be in the  1000 range soon enough  Sony put together a great package of features and finally produced a model that will get the attention of serious amateur photographers br

Auto, First of I must say I am a GM person  It 146s not that often that I find myself straying from the GM pack  But Because of certain reason I now find myself looking for an new car and as a joke I went to the local Hyundai dealership to test drive a new Tiburon with the 2 7L V6  By the end of the test drive I found that what I thought would be a poorly built joke to be a very nice affordable sports coupe that gives competition a huge run for the money b First Impressions i Exterior b i There were 2 models I was looking at one was silver the other was black  Both had very unique styling  This gave it a very sporty and appealing look  I noticed the large sport spoiler which made the car look even better  The tail lights gave the car a sporty look but also offered other motorist visibility  It also had dual exhaust which sounded amazing when the sales person fired up the car  I couldn 146t resist and had to take it for a spin b i Interior b i When getting in the car I had mixed feelings  The first thing I noticed was leather seats  And what got me was not only did it have leather seats but they are standard in the V6 model  What cars do you know that offer standard leather seats for under 20K  The dash and gauges seemed a little plain which is where I get the mixed feelings from  But really when looking at the overall design of the car it fits in quite nice  And with the dealership installed dash kit you can add some color and make them look fantastic  The sets were a little stiff and I m not sure how well the leather seats would hold up long term  The gauges are easy to read it did take me awhile to get everything adjusted  but I wouldn 146t really consider that as to being a design problem b The Test Drive b I have had an automatic for the last 2 years so I was expecting to kill the car a few times due to some hills and snow  However not once in the test drive did I kill the car or did it hesitate  The 6 speed manual was extremely simple to operate  The only thing that we couldn 146t figure out was how to put the car in reverse  It took about 10 min to figure it out  you have to pull up on the handle and then put it in reverse  I headed straight for the highway after leaving the dealership to see what the V6 6 speed combo was made of  There was a base mustang next to me in the other lane  And he was showing off trying to be cool  So I decided to test shifting  I downshifted and took of down the street  The look on the guys face was worth the test drive alone  The gears are easy to find and the clutch is excellent  Indianapolis is going through a lot or road construction so there were a lot of bumps and bad roads  The car did well over them but at times it seemed the car was so stiff that it just kind of jumps over them  That created a somewhat harsh ride quality b Specifications b The Hyundai Coupe is offered in either 2 0L 4 cylinder  producing 133hp 4800 rpm  or 2 7L V6  producing 177 4000 rpm  Both have a standard 5 speed manual with an optional 4 speed shiftronic automatic  The V6 model has an available 6 speed manual available with a package group  Front Suspension on both is an Independent McPherson struts w Coil springs and a rear Independents Multi link with coil springs  sport tuned n the V6 models  4 wheel disc brakes are standard all around abs is optional  16  silver painted alloy wheels are standard on the base model and the automatic V6 model  17  Machine finish alloy wheels are standard on the manual V6 s b i Dimensions Exterior b i Wheelbase 99 6 Length 173 0 Height 52 3 Width 69 3 Track  front rear  58 7 b i Interior b i Head Room  fr rear  38 0 34 4 Leg Room 43 0 29 9 Shoulder Room 53 9 50 6 Hip Room 51 6 44 7 Cargo Volume 14 7 Passenger Volume 81 9 b i EPA b i 2 0L 4 cyl   City Highway 5 Speed Manual 23 31 4 Speed Auto 23 30 2 7L V6  City Highway 6 Speed Manual 18 26 5 Speed Manual 19 26 4 Speed Auto 20 26 Fuel Capacity 14 5 Gallons b Pricing b The base Tiburon  if that 146s what you want to call it  starts at 16 7K  with destination charge  with the standard package  The only thing that 146s optional is the rear spoiler  leather seats  sunroof  and abs  The auto starts at 17 6K b i The Tiburon GT V6   Starts at 18 5K with the 5 speed manual transmission  18 7K for the 6 speed manual and 19 4K for the shiftronic automatic  Options for the GT model include sunroof  abs  aluminum foot covers  And high body spoiler on the GT 6 speed  
Auto, Back in January I started looking for a new car to replace my Acura Integra  It ultimately came down to the BMW 328Ci and Audi A4 2 8  I liked the more aggressive styling of the BMW 3 series but I couldn t justify the  38 000 price tag for the 328Ci  about  5k more for essentially 20 more horsepower vs  the 323Ci  so in the ultimate feat of rationalization I opted for the Audi S4 which was  2k more than the 328Ci  with the added benefit of 60 more horsepower  full time 4 wheel drive  and an extra 2 doors   I ended up ordering a 2001 model at the end of March and it arrived at the dealer at the end of June  The major differences between the 2000 and 2001 models are  1   1k higher sticker price  2  addition of ESP  electronic stability program  3  Sport package became an added cost option  and 4  longer warranty  4yr 50k mi  Be prepared for a wait if you plan on purchasing the S4 since it s a limited production car  especially in California I ve had my 2001 S4 for about 1700 miles now  and I ve loved every single mile of it  It s metallic silver with the onyx  black  interior  with the premium package  aka convenience package on the 2000 model  and Bose audio system  I opted to not get the 6 disc changer option since the OEM unit  Panasonic  can be had for  279 aftermarket vs   650 installed with the car b Engine Performance  This car is a pleasure to drive  It s got incredible torque at low RPM s  258 lb ft   1850 3600 rpm  so acceleration is effortless  and downright wicked if you floor it  It took a while for me to get used to the car s power as I was unintentionally launching like a rocket at green lights since I was used to the engine of my former  torque weak  Acura Integra  Also  the car is very composed at highway speeds  so much so that I often don t realize that I was going 80  mph when I thought I was going 60 since the cabin is very quiet and composed The six speed took a little getting used to since the reverse gear is next to 1 2  you push down  then left past 1 2  then up whereas on my Integra it was down from 5th gear  The throws are much longer as well  feels like you ll be elbowing people in the back seat  which is the only real driveability drawback that I see in this otherwise amazing car  An aftermarket short shifter is definitely on the upgrade list The car is after all a 4 door sedan  so it s not nearly as tossable as my old Integra  There is more lean that I would like when i toss the car from side to side  but it s pretty taut for a stock suspension  Regardless  I feel it s got a good balance between performance and comfort  I ve autocrossed the car once  and it definitely needs a stiffer and lower suspension for these type of events  but for everyday driving it s a good compromise Oh yeah  there is quite a lively aftermarket for the S4 there are at least 4 aftermarket tuners that you can go to for a new ECU which will easily bump your horsepower in the 310 hp range  stock is 250hp  and torque into the 360 ft lbs range  stock is 258 ft lbs  for about  500 600  So if you ever tire of the stock 250hp engine  you ve got options  b Interior  The front seats are comfortable and I never felt fatigued from the seats during extended driving  I wish the side bolsters were a little more beefy or adjustable  though  The rear seats are quite cramped  and I wished Audi would have made the cavernous trunk a little smaller so that passengers would have a little more legroom  They d almost be more comfortable laying down in the trunk  If you ve ever seen the truck of the S4 A4 you ll know what I mean    If the trunk wasn t big enough for you  you can also fold down the 60 40 rear seats and fit your groceries for the next 6 months in there  Audi placed 2 cup holders under the center arm rest hello  You need to keep the arm rest up if you want to use either of these cup holders  but luckily there is a neat little retractable cup holder in the center console that you have more direct access to Driving with the sunroof open at highway speeds creates a loud droning sound between 35 45 mph  This is very annoying  but my solution is to drive faster   It s unexcusable  though  to have this happen on a  40k  car  never had this problem in my Integra  There is also wind noise from the side mirrors at highway speeds  a slight whistling sound  too To use the cruise control you have to fiddle with a stalk on the steering column  To accelerate after you activated cruise control  you press the button on the end of the stalk  but to slow down you have to use a different slider switch  which also serves to turn the cruise on off  Clumsy to say the least  I wish they placed the controls on the steering wheel like my old Integra b Exterior  The Avus rims are a huge brake dust magnet  I ve been told that applying car wax to the rims will help with cleaning  Any which way  I think I ll be cleaning off brake dust quite often  I didn t like the styling of the rims initially  but it has grown on me and now I like them b Audio  The Bose system sounds pretty decent for a stock radio  albeit a little too heavy on the bass  I listen to a lot of bass heavy music  trance  house  hip hop  etc  so the system s bass heavy emphasis works nicely for me  but it gets a little irratating after prolonged listening sometimes  I haven t really cranked it up  but I have heard from others that the bass gets muddy at higher volumes as well b Maintenance  Every 2001 Audi comes with a 4yr 50 000 mile warranty  2001 models received a longer warranty than previous years  during which time all scheduled maintenance is included with the car purchase even down to replacing windshield wipers b Summary  Wow  Go get one  You won t be disappointed  You ll notice that the negatives that I wrote up are really all minor nit picks consider this a plus since I really don t see any major downpoints with this car br br  
Auto, I recently took the top three full size pick ups for a test drive  I own a 2000 Silverado  and was in the market for another truck for my son  I must say I didn t drive the GMC  because it really is the same as the Chevy  The Dodge was my first choice  mostly because it was the least expensive  kinda  The interior of the Dodge was great  it was a huge wide open area  well instrumented and comfortable  It gave you a good solid feeling while sitting behind the wheel  Both the Dodge and the Chevy made you feel like you were driving a livingroom down the road  Lots of room  nice comfortable seats  The Ford felt kinda cramped  and a little on the cheesy side inside  I didn t get the feeling of quality from Ford  What a shame  they make a good product  Since kids are kids  and he will be wanting to drive around his friends  I looked at the extended cab versions of Dodge and Chevy  Here is where I started to draw my line  The Dodge s rear seat was nothing more than just a board covered with cloth  Very uncomfortable  I had the dealer drive me around while I sat in the back  I felt like a real goober sitting back there  no wonder I use to call shot gun  The Chevy had a larger  more comfortable seat  It still wasn t much  but it was much better  Then for the killer  The gas mileage  The Dodge drank gas compared to the Chevy  Two miles to the gallon really adds up over the years  Believe me  I ve been driving these gas drinkers for years  and I value my mileage  The Dodge is a nice vehicle  but for a few  just a few  dollars more  I went for the Chevy  I felt it had more quality  and the milage will help out in the long haul br br  
Camera, For anyone looking to venture into the world of digital cameras  you cannot go wrong with the Pentax Optio 33L  This camera is packed with so many features that even camera enthusiasts will enjoy this camera  What is truly surprising is that the Optio 33L can be purchased at an amazingly low price of around  200  Most other 3 megapixel cameras with these type of features still sell for  300 to  400  Let s take a closer look b Features  While many people  myself included  tend to only use basic features and ignore the more complex features  I found myself experimenting and playing with all the features that come loaded onto the Pentax Optio 33L  Why is this  I think the main reason is because the menus were so easy to navigate that it was almost fun A few of my favorite features are as follows  First of all  I love the digital filters that come preset with the camera  These filters include Sepia  B W  B W Red  B W Blue  our personal favorite  B W Green  Blue  Red  and Green  My wife always pays those over priced photo studios major bucks to add filtering to their pictures  Once my wife saw how great this camera took pictures using the digital filters  she vowed to never pay extra at those studios ever again A second feature I love is the preset camera settings that come built in  You can choose from portrait  flower  landscape  3 D  panarama  night scene  or you can manually program your own settings using the sharpness  contrast and saturation settings  The Optio 33L is one of the few cameras in this price range that gives you these manual controls  We tend to use the portrait mode most  but I have had fun playing around with the panarama mode Another lesser known feature  but one of the main reasons we bought the camera  is the P I M II capability  P I M stands for print image matching and what this means is that your printed photos will be enhanced using a P I M printer  nice marketing technique since Epson is the one selling these printers  We bought the Epson Stylus Photo 825 and received a  75 rebate just because we bought a camera that was P I M enabled  You can t beat getting a nice photo printer for  25  So how do the P I M enhanced pictures come out  Excellent  The images are crisp  clear and vibrant and are identical to what you see when you take the picture  We couldn t be happier Let me quickly run down some of the other nice features  The camera has a 3x optical and 2 7x digital zoom for an impressive 8x combined zoom  I like the position of the zoom button and it is easy to use  Closeups come out sharp and clear  It has a nice swivel LCD screen that allows you to take self portrait or groups shot  This is extremely handy when taking a group photo as everyone can see the countdown timer and knows when the picture will be taken  You can create a 30 second movie  fun to play with but not very good quality  or see a slide show of your photos  We usually use the included video cable to hook it up to the TV to watch the slide show  Our kids get a kick out of it  You can also protect your favorite photos and save your favorite camera settings  I also like the fact that you only need two AA batteries to power the camera as opposed to the four AA batteries that most other cameras require  Just make sure you use NIMH rechargeables  which are a wise investment with any digital camera purchase  All in all this is one feature packed camera b Drawbacks  I ve heard many reviewers of this camera complain about the lack of a viewfinder  I ll admit that it would be nice to have a viewfinder  but as I use the camera more and more it becomes less of an issue for me  Once in a great while I have a hard time seeing the LCD screen in extremely bright sunlight  but once I attached the include LCD sunblocker  just a flimsy piece of black cardboard  I could see the LCD screen just fine Another drawback is the shutter lag  but I have to say that most cameras in this price range have some sort of shutter lag  What is neat about this camera is that you can halfway depress the picture taking button to warm up the camera  Once you see the red light you can press the button the rest of the way and the photo will be taken instantaneously  It takes some practice  but I ve gotten pretty good at it Finally  the camera tends to white out the images in dark settings  This is easily solved  however  if you learn to use the proper settings b Final Comments  This is a great 3 34 megapixel camera that gives you plenty of bang for your buck  Sure  there are nicer 3 megapixel cameras out there but you will pay considerably more for them  
Camera, After years of using my Yashica F109 35mm SLR  with a manual focus  for occasions such as parties  weddings  etc  I was ready for an upgrade  I initially intended to buy a fully automatic 35mm film camera  as prices are very competitive these days  My hesitation with a digital camera purchase was my belief that the pictures would not be comparable in quality with that of a good film camera  However  after looking at photos taken by a friend with a Fuji 3mp camera  I was convinced that I could be happy with a digital camera and jumped on the  net to do some research   Actually  epinions com was one of the first places I visited  And yes  the three reviews above did help me make my decision  After realizing the obvious benefits of owning a digital camera  I made a short list of the cameras I could afford  since I only wanted to spend about 300 00  and headed to Circuit City  I chose the D550 because of it s price  size  and features  The camera comes with the  standard  16 mb card  but hey  all of the cameras I looked at had the same thing   I purchased a 64mb card for another  35 00  After bringing the camera home and opening the package  I discovered the first of only three issues I have with this camera to date   the manual provided inside the box is very small  and does not include all the info you want or need  Yes  there is a more detailed manual on the CD  but who wants to boot up a computer just to read about spot metering  Anyhow  I read the manual and immediately began taking pictures  The menus on the lcd screen are not complicated  and easy to navigate  You can also post thumbnail type pics on the screen  9 at a time  to view what you have so far on disk  For a person with their first digital camera  that was a pleasant suprise  I was really impressed with the picture quality  after using the  zoom in  feature to take a closer look at the picture as it was displayed on the lcd  I took several pics in different settings   low light  daytime outdoors  and interior with artificial light  The real test  however  was how the pics would look after being printed out  I hooked it up to my computer which runs on win 98  and it took with no problems  The CD included has a detailed manual  along with the Camedia 4 0 software  After installing the camera s driver  however  I discovered the second issue   there is no ac adaptor included with the camera  so you have to use the battery power to transfer your pictures to the computer  and it doesn t seem that the batteries last long when you re doing so much with the camera taking pics  previewing them  and then transfering to the pc  yes  the camera must be  on  for you to transfer the pics  What I ended up doing was buying a  15 00 PNY smartmedia card reader writer   USB  and installed that instead  Now  I just take the card out of the camera  and isert it into the reader  I save my camera s batteries  and the reader writer requires no power supply  The pics transfer at a good rate  and my problem is solved  I then tested the software  which I must say I m happy with  Now I m no professional photographer  and you probably aren t either  so I d say that most people are like me and would be more than happy with the software  It allows you to preview the pics  crop  resize  rotate  add text or clean up the pics  and lets you not only print out the pics in different packages  but has templates for greeting cards  post cards  calenders  etc  Yeah  the templates aren t endless  but what do you want for  300 00  photoshop 7 from Adobe  The software is more than adequate  I printed out several pics using my Cannon S600  which only prints at 1200 X 1200  and I must say I m very impressed  I printed out one 5 x 7  a calender with a good size pic on it  and 9 wallet size pics on a single sheet  All of the pictures came out great  and I have absolutely no complaints about their quality  The drag and drop ease of the software makes it a breeze to use  So  although I have to insert the CD to read the more detailed instructions  I m happy with my purchase choice  You won t go wrong with this camera  I can t speak about shutter speeds yet  because I haven t tested this camera a ability to shoot moving targets  Personally  that s not what I bought the camera for  So far  though  this camera has not failed to impress me  It s exactly what I needed  and I am now officially part of the digital camera enthusiasts  club  My next obsession will probably be a 12 megapixel digital SLR   Wow  what will that be like  
Camera, Loaded to the Max Canon EOS D30 Well I ve done just up graded my digital camera again  not that I was un happy with my Epson and my Kodak DC  I simply wanted to try the Canon EOS D30  A friend of mine owns one and he never stop bragging of how good it is  I saw some of the shot he took with it and I must say that I was impressed with the results PRODUCT DESCRIPTION The Canon EOS D30 is the first digital camera that captures images using a CMOS chips instead of a CCD  I feel that for the quality of this camera it is a very good deal at the price it is selling on the market  the reason I say this is because the EOS D30 comes with a slew of high end features that are mostly found on much more expensive apparatus The EOS D30 is fully compatible with all Canon EF lenses which ads 1 6X magnification  The camera will store images in JPEG or RAW format on CF Type I or II cards The body is made of a lightweight compact polycarbonate with a stainless steel chassis  This makes the Canon EOS D30 a very sturdy camera FEATURES The Canon EOS D30 is loaded with features  here some of the most important ones  It has USB and video out ports  A built in auto pop up flash  The controls are large and easy to adjust  A LCD top deck that easy to read and is well organized  A focusing point selection button that provides an excellent mean of selecting the active sensor  Controls that are placed in an easy to see and activated  A quick control dial that can be used to adjust the aperture  A side door that protects the memory cards  ISO range from 100 to 1600  13 custom functions  Resolution of 1125H x 1150V x 1050D  A preset white balance  A mirror lock up setting for reducing the vibration  A PC sync connector for studio flash  A playback mode to view older files OPTIONAL ITEMS The Canon EOS D30 camera can be equipped with the following optional features  An optional BG ED3 grip that will also old two BP 511 batteries  The grip will also add vertical shooting controls for the shutter and the AF select buttons It will cost you an extra  200 00 The dual battery holder will extend the shooting capability to 1 200 high res shots  An optional Canon 380EX Speedlite which sells for about  150 00 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I find this camera to an ideal one for shooting portraits  outdoor scenes  sporting event outdoor and even indoor if the place is well lit  I still kept my Kodak PC 500  for the rough stuff excursion in the jungles of Asia of the forest of North America but my Canon EOS D30 is the camera I use for the regular camera needs I have  
Camera, I ve been a professional photographer for more than 20 years I ve been interested in digital cameras for about 9 years when I first purchased an Apple Quicktake Cute camera though the photos looked best on screen It was a start on my digital life though About 8 digicams later I moved up to the Nikon D100 I got one of the early batches with one phone call even though I was on a RITZ list for ages they didn t come thru as quick as just picking up the phone on a whim So I ve had this camera for at least 5 months now and use it in my work as a photographer I shoot alot of editorial and PR work so my lighting and situations are always different Early on I realized my Nikon SB 28 flash would not give good results with this camera and I purchased the SB 80DX Soon after I realized my 3rd party lenses would be giving me error messages and would stop functioning when the D100 would not recognize that a lens was attached So I bought all new Nikon lenses Big ones little ones short ones expensive ones I am not alone when I say that every photo taken inside outside and with or without flash is underexposed and not very sharp I ve sat in the same position using every single setting that this camera has and it s not been remedied I ve also used ever Nikon AF lens I own from the 16mm fisheye to the 80 200 2 8 D Photoshop will fix everything up I use PS 7 on a Mac but when I do a big job and come back with 1500 images the last thing I want is a numb arm and blood shot eyes from being in front of the computer for 2 days making adjustments I have spoken with many other pros that have this problem as well Nikon denies a problem exists but will go on to say that it s careful not to blow out the highlights and whites because if that happens you have a completely unusable image I shoot in jpeg format since I have to shoot alot and shoot fast so I don t really need the Nikon 3 capture software that cost appx  150 00 But since I have to do color correction and saturation adjustments on most images I have not found a batch solution that is workable and repeatable I have shot a few RAW images and they looked good I did not purchase the Nikon capture 3 software so after 30 days it expired The best digicam software is from the Kodak high end cameras It amazes me that Nikon would charge for their software which isn t very good anyway I m not sorry I bought the D100 as the pros are that the battery life is excellent and it fits well in my hand and the weight is good I borrowed a D1X and it was too heavy for all day jobs for me My next digicam will most likely be the Kodak 14N or whatever  The big files appeal to me for BIG prints and my stock photography needs big files as well I know Kodaks pro cameras have always been the best around and ditto for their software Unless of course Nikon improves on the D100  
Camera, Even I am sometimes guilty of the spontaneous purchase   the thrill of saying  quot yeah I ll take it quot  with absolutely NO CLUE whether what you re buying is a quality item or is even worth the price of the fluff sitting at the bottom of your pocket Buying the DSC S30 was one of those moments  and while it was an exciting purchase  my wife and I have wanted a digital camera for ages  there was that little voice softly saying  quot but what if it s a lemon quot  Thankfully  we ignored that little voice  because this time throwing caution to the wind paid off big time  Not only had we made a good choice  but in fact we d made  the  good choice The camera was bought at Sears  They had the price set at the full retail of  499  With a price match to the local Best Buy of  399 and the Sony rebate of  100  for also buying a Vaio  that s another tale  the final price was  299 plus tax  Just beautiful  What s even more satisfying is that it s easily worth  499 when considering what other similar cameras are going for now So on to the camera Setting it up was a breeze  really just a few short steps  attach the lens cover  attach the carrying strap  plug in the battery  or hook up to wall power  insert the memory stick  and you re off  Or so I thought  Interesting anecdote here  and remember that I was new to digital cameras  I got it all set up  thanks to the manual  which is straightforward  and tried to take a picture  I pressed the shutter button  heard a beep  saw something on the LCD  but no picture  What  I tried a million different things  from formatting the memory stick to using different resolutions to adjusting the flash  the focus  you name it  I learned a lot about the camera during that mad frenzy to take a picture  that s for sure  I was just about ready to give up and call it broken when I noticed something in the manual about  quot press the shutter button halfway quot  OH  DUH With that out of the way  I took about 20 pictures of everything I could find in the house  My wife  the cat  a pumpkin  myself  nothing was safe  It was so much fun Let s go over the pros of the camera b Display b  The LCD display is very bright and crisp  and aiming the camera using it seems natural  You can even make it brighter with a slider on the side of the camera  Navigating the camera s many features using the on screen interface is painless and intuitive  Sony s menu system is arranged very nicely and the one button controller works surprisingly well  I was able to try out most of the features for the first time without referring to the manual b Battery b  Sony s InfoLITHIUM battery charges fully in a bit less than two hours  and according to the manual lasts that long while in use  My own experiences seem to agree with this  A very nice feature is that the camera reports the approximate number of minutes of charge remaining on the battery  Very handy b Memory Stick b  Sony s proprietary memory system  These little sticks hold memory up to 128MB and I hear that 256 and 512MB versions are on the way  That s a LOT of pictures  understatement  We picked up a 16MB stick with the camera for about  30  since it only comes with 4MB  The only problem I can see with these sticks is that they re so small   it d be very easy to lose track of one  Transfers from the memory stick  inside the camera  to the PC are a snap  The camera comes with a USB cable   just connect the cable between the camera and the PC  The first time you do this  it will install some drivers  included on a CD with the camera  and away you go  The memory stick from that point on is recognized by Windows as a removeable drive  and the files are stored there as JPG or TIFF  so you can simply copy them from there to your hard drive  or view them right from the memory stick  Couldn t hardly be easier b Lens Picture Quality  The lens is a 3x optical zoom lens  with up to 6x digital zoom  Another great feature of the camera is that the level of zoom is displayed on a bar on the LCD when it s being adjusted  Even better is that it indicates when you re leaving optical zoom and entering digital zoom mode  It also has a macro mode  good for focus at down to 3cm  Practically a microscope at that level   you can easily make a dime fill the entire display and still be in focus  The picture quality is just outstanding as well  Colors are vibrant and seem true  For a camera in this price range  I was impressed b Extras  The camera is loaded with features  but a couple stand out to me  First off  you can hook up the output of the LCD display to a TV or anything with a composite video input  using a supplied cable  This means you can hook it up to a VCR and actually use it as a movie camera  WOW  Of course you re limited by the length of the cable  but still  Also  the slide show mode is awesome  In this mode  as you d expect  it cycles through all the photos currently on the memory stick  Now combine these two features  and you have a stroke of Sony genius  run a slide show of your photos on your TV  The quality of output to the TV is really really good   I was amazed by how good it looked  One final feature I m glad they included was the ability to store images in uncompressed TIFF format  Even though it s a memory hog  it s really worth it  You tend to forget that JPG does degrade image quality since it looks so good  but comparing the two you definitely notice artifacts in the JPG output  Take a few photos using the camera s highest resolution in TIFF format if you want to impress your friends The Cons  yes there are a couple b No optical viewfinder b  Most of the time this isn t an issue  because the digital viewfinder is so bright  But in extremely bright conditions  an optical viewfinder would have been nice b Lens Button Design b  I m not terribly fond of the placement for the buttons which operate the user interface  The problem is that I tend to use the thumb of my left hand to use these buttons  and in this position it s natural for the forefingers of this hand to grasp the camera by the lens  Often I have to remember not to do that  A minor gripe to be sure  but a gripe nonetheless Conclusion This camera practically has it all and then some  with a few bonus features I wasn t expecting  In its price class it can t be beat  and I am extremely pleased with my  quot accidental quot  purchase  Very highly recommended br br  
Auto, The Toyota Solara Convertible is a huge mistake by Toyota  It is a butchered stock Solara instead of a convertible built from the ground up The Solara is a good car in many respects  Pre Convertible conversion  The acceleration is outstanding on the V6 and it is loaded with lots of amenities if you are willing to pay enough  This includes power everything  leather upholstery  etc As for the convertible  the chopped off top results in a lack of stability in the structure and you gets a noisy uncomfortable ride  The top itself is poorly designed and does not seem to be 100  air tight  Occasionally droplets of water will sneak in  and you will have lots of road noise  The car rides quieter with the top down Another annoying feature is that you cannot bring the top back up unless you are in park  The Chrysler Sebring allows you to do it if you are going slow enough So if you are caught in 5mph traffic with exhaust in your face  you cannot bring the top up Toyota needs to redesign this from scratch to get it right  
Camera, Before I go any further  I ll let you know right now that I really like this camera  but as with any product  there are a few things I would change  Also  the customer service at Kodak is HORRIBLE I think the camera takes really good quality pictures  The colors are very bright  and the images are sharp  It has three different image quality settings  and also allows you to choose between megapixel resolution and 640 x 480 resolution  The second option is especially good because sometimes you don t want huge screen filling pictures that the megapixel setting records  so you can take the picture at the lower resolution  This option is especially good when designing websites With the quality set to the highest  and the resolution in megapixel mode  the camera takes about 25 pictures with the 8 mb Compact Flash card that is included  But another payoff of the 640 x 480 setting is that when set at this resolution at highest quality mode  the camera can literally take about 60 pictures on the 8 mb card  I think that s awesome  I ended up buying another 8 mb card  and with just the two cards I had more than enough space to take pictures on my first trip to New York City earlier this month The user interface is another really good feature of the camera  The on screen menu options are really easy to understand and are in a really user friendly font type  Ok  here are some pet peeves about the camera  It eats batteries like no other  I ve found that the rate that the camera uses batteries  4 AA s  is amazing  I bought some rechargeable batteries and a recharger and that solved my problem  The camera is pretty hefty  It s a lot heavier than my last camera  and has kind of a bulky shape  It won t fit easily into your pocket    The rubber covers covering the AC adapter connection  the transfer cable connection  and the output connection at the side of the camera are kind of cheap feeling and flimsy  The time it takes to transfer pictures is really slow  A lot slower than my first camera The absolute worst problem with the camera  something Kodak REALLY needs to work on is it s phone based support  It is HORRIBLE  I really cannot stress how negative my experience in this area has been  My AC adapter broke  and I called to send it in to be repaired under warranty  The MINIMUM waiting time any time I called was 15 minutes  I sent the camera to Kodak  but instead of coming back in 7 10 days like they said  it arrived 3 weeks later  But to make things worse  the first time I used the adapter  I found that they had not fixed the problem  I had to call back repeatedly  one time being put on hold for OVER AN HOUR  The reps are nice  but the waiting time is horrible and I m really mad that I have to go through the hassle again since they didn t fix it the first time Ok  that s pretty much the end of my commentary on the camera  Overall  I d say it s really good camera  a 4for sure  but get s downgraded to a 3 because of my horrible experience on hold for hours upon hours with Kodak  If you d like to read on  it s just the story of how I got the camera and it compared to my last one  The DC 210 plus zoom is my second digital camera  My first was a Pretec brand camera that my mom bought me off of AOL before I went to college  It was a 640 x 480 pixel camera that had no zoom  That was a good first camera  but after a while I really wanted a zoom lens and better quality pictures   That first camera cost about  225 I think I began looking around for a camera that had a zoom lens  megapixel ability  and good quality pictures  I literally spent hours browsing different websites trying to decide which to buy  I visited about every different site that had reviews of cameras and comparison tests of digital cameras  For the money  it seemed that the Kodak was the best bet I didn t buy the camera out of any retail store  but instead I bought it on Ebay from a camera shop in Washington for  266  including shipping  This was a great price  I bought it and ended up giving my old one to my brother  My first camera was a great one  but the pictures on the Kodak are a lot better br br  
Camera, The HP 612 is a good family camera  It works as a point and shot for all the family tech idiots  which includes most of the population  but will do enough fancy stuff to keep the shutter savvy busy for a while  If you want to focus other than center  you can with this one  You can zoom  Flash settings are adjustable  including a shut off for those moments ruined by a photo flash bombs busting in air  But  you don t have to worry about anything if you are a  look in the hole   or LCD screen  kind of person  There are 3 basic kinds of digital cameras you can buy  The old ones with the 3 5 disc storage are being phased out  Though it seems a nice idea to have the photos on the 3 5  you can t store much  You have a bulky camera and disks all over the place  The newest CD  mini  size are really high dollar  but they may very well be the ones that come out on top  That leaves the mid range cameras like the HP 612 that use memory cards which are similar to the 3 5 disks but are smaller and hold a lot more  When I looked over the Compact Flash style cameras  I decided to go with the HP 612  There were several reasons I went with this one after reading online and trying out digital cameras at work and with family cameras  I just have no shame at all and will say   Let me check that out  So  here is how I decided        You don t have to be a rocket scientist to use this camera b  Since I have two little boys and one who especially loves to take pictures  I wanted a camera that was really easy to use  Eli could not take photos with the Canon digital from work  It was just too complex  Even the college students had a heck of time getting anything worth printing  This one involves looking in the viewfinder hole and then pushing the button  It works just like his Canon Owl 35 mm point and shoot which is a wonderful starter camera for little guys  The box button on the back of the HP above the LCD viewer means that the shot shows in the LCD to check out shots  just push the button  and that is just one click in addition to pushing the top button to take the picture  Eli uses both those options easy as pie point and shoot and then almost easy as pie with the LCD  It took him about 5 minutes to nail the basics on this camera  and he is 9 years old   It s pocket size b  No one wants to be the holder of the stuff  At the best you can do if you have kids  you have all kinds of things that you have to haul around  I never thought I would carry the monster purse  since I usually jammed my important stuff in my Levi s pocket  Now  I do carry the purse   and this camera can be tucked right in for the ride  It is the size of the regular 35mm quick pic cameras  The HP doesn t come with any sort of case  so I would suggest that you protect it with something  You can buy the case  or you can use any kind of sturdy little bag  I have a little drawstring denim bag that works just fine  It keeps the camera clean and protects it  The carry handle is not the greatest and won t go around you neck  but it s OK  I keep the camera in my purse or around my wrist   You can buy your batteries at the Quick Trip on the corner b  OK  I know that AA batteries are not the best way to go  but I like a camera that will work with the garden variety batteries  Perhaps this bias comes from living overseas where I had to point and grunt  I hated to need things that I could not describe even in English  I still do not know how to say sage in Greek  and I did not have sage in the dressing balls I made that Thanksgiving  Dressing balls are not very good without sage  Give me batteries I can recognize at a glance  Anyway  this camera will work with any AA batteries you stick in the bottom  It holds four of those  They do not last very long  We run through a set of four almost every time we take pictures  Our style is to carry the camera around for a couple of hours and shoot things at a birthday party or at a cook out  We run about 2 rolls per set of batteries in the 35 mm world or about 48 digital pics  If I am the keeper of the camera and I m more careful about the juice  then I can get around double  The average adult could get 100 photos on a set of batteries  Right now  I am saving up to get the charger that plugs in the wall socket for rechargeable batteries  We have that at work  and it is a good idea  You charge and use the batteries over and over  That will be pretty expensive  but it does pay off in the long run  If you can afford the charger and recharge batteries  I would suggest that you get 2 sets of batteries and rotate those in the camera  You can always fall back on the regular AA when you have to b If you re thinking about getting this camera  then you do need to buy some other things        oh sigh wish it all came together b  The real must have would be the media card  Actually  it works out really nice to have two of those  They are like the 3 5 disks  but they are smaller  Just take the camera to the store and say you need a media card  Or  you can look in the booklet and find out what you need and buy online  Check out Fat Wallet  www fatwallet com  and click at the top to Forums and watch the message strings  You ll see good deals come up  I got a Smart Media card for half the local price by doing that  but I got the first one at the local store to make sure I got the right thing  The reason you want the media cards is that the camera has only 8 bites of memory  That means about 24 pics stored depending on the quality you set that for  the default is the mid range  If you can take the time to check and then discard all unwanted pics on the spot to make room for more or if you stay at home all the time and can upload the photos  then you may be OK  I wouldn t bank on that though  If you get some pics on the camera and not on the disk  then you can read the booklet that comes with the camera and upload right from the camera to the disk  That is much easier I think  I try not to put any pics on the 8 mb on the camera  but sometimes I forget the memory card and then have pics there on the camera which don t show when you stick in the memory card  Media cards come in lots of sizes as far as what they hold  They all look the same on the outside other than the numbers printed  I go with 64 for that and have 2 of them  They hold about 125 photos  which is enough around here  I keep one in the camera and one in the printer most times and switch out when one gets full  That reminds me to look and see what I want to get rid of or print  You don t have to buy a printer  You can use the one you have if it is color  Do buy photo paper though  so the pictures will look like pictures  It s nicer to have a printer made for photos though  I got the HP 1115  The nice thing here is that I can put the memory card right in the printer and then make 4 6 photos on the spot by the numbers of the shots  it does not show the picture on the printer  Though it seems like a nice idea to have all those memories stored on disk  it is just not the same to have computer pictures  They are not as much fun to look at as hard copies  One way around the printer problem is that you can take the pics and then upload to SnapFish  www snapfish com  Once you have the pics up and can look at them  you can edit at SF and then can order the prints you want  That s a little extra work  but that can work out if you don t want to spring for the printer b The HP 612 is not better than homemade biscuits b  Though I love this camera  there are some things that I don t like  They are not major things  but they are part of the package  The big thing for me is that digital has lag time  In other words  you push the button and then it drags for a split second  That means that it is hard to get action shots  Kids are active  so I miss a lot I would want to capture and could capture with a 35 mm  I usually carry both a pocket 35 mm and this camera and get all I want with the two cameras  One nice thing about digital is that you have the LCD screen and can really look at the shot before you snap  But  the LCD is really hard to see when the sun is out  I find it better to use the regular viewfinder outside  When you use the LCD  you get a black flash up and know you took a picture  When you use the viewfinder  you press and don t hear a sound  You will wonder if you actually took the picture  I often shoot 2 or 3 thinking that I did not really make a picture  I don t catch this until I review on the LCD  which works great to see what you shot or put it up on the computer and look  On the plus side  I often get better pics when I have 2 or 3 shots  Yes  This one does eat batteries  and so do all the digital cameras  I m used to 35 mm which will go on and on with the same batteries  It took me a while to learn to always carry extras  This is just part of the digital camera world right now  I hope that gets better  That covers the basics      b But  how about the options b  This camera does let you play around some  It does not have as many options as some  but it has as much as I would want  unless I could afford the professional level digital which I can t  You can push the button on the back and get the menu and make the selections and also on editing some with the photos on the spot  like you can dump a bad one  The book covers it well that you get with the camera  and I can use these options when I want to  Off center focus is the one thing I use the most  I hate really flat photos  and this lets me make some changes with good results  Box in on what you want to highlight  Push the button to take pictures half way down  Then all the way down  Easy enough  The zoom 2x can be nice  Be aware that zoom does not have the same quality that standard would have  It s better to walk in than to zoom in  The various flash options are good  It has fill flash and also OFF flash  The main one I use is the off when I don t want to light up a room  The software for photos is OK  The big thing is that you do not get a booklet to cover how to use that  I use software at work and can guess on most of that  They do have some directions that you can pull up on the computer  but it is still nice to have directions to hold in your hand and look at  One of my students who never used much software called the company and raised cain about that and got a free book to help her  I think I will borrow that  so I don t have to guess so much b Do you want to spring for this camera b  If you want an easy digital camera that takes good pictures  then I would say this one is solid  You ll really want to add on with the other items that do run the price up but make life easier  To get the Media Card and the printer  I think it about double the price overall  so figure on  500 to do this  The batteries and charger will jack it up a bit more but save you money down the road  I m not going top rate on this one  because I don t think digital cameras have maxed out yet as far as being wonderful at home  I still fall back on my 35mm  but this HP is great for what it is and what it does  If I had to pick again  I would go with this one  
Camera, Having looked around the Web for a digital camera I was looking at either the Z1 or the Canon EOD300 Rebel  Unfortunately the Rebel was out of my price range so I bought the Z1  Overall I made a very good choice The camera takes good pictures in the majority of circumstances  You can have full control over the aperture  exposure and focus should you wish too  The camera can take over some or all of the functions too if you wish Low light shooting is easy and there is an option for sunset preserve to keep the warmth of a picture rather than overexpose to simulate full light  Fast moving objects need good light  as you would expect  but the camera can still operate at speeds approaching 1600 ISO  the speeds are quoted in seconds and fractions so you will have to convert to ISO yourself if you are that way inclined Night shooting is an exercise in steadyness and the threaded mount is inline with the lens so tripods are easy to attach and use with the camera  The position of the trigger means taht a decent push is needed often spoiling the shot through movement on the tripod  I tended to use the time delay function after lining the shot up  since the exposur time was generally 2 seconds you wouldnt be able to take moment in time shots anyway as you would blur  however if motion blur was wanted for a set time then the lack of a remote may hinder you The flash was good with the red eye reduction setting annoying  3 distinct flashes are used rather than the usual strobe  but effective The viewfinder shows a full picture but it has an obvious border so you will get more than you see  The LCD screen shows the full picture  observed by me not scientifically proved  The viewfinder and LCD screen are served by the same mechanism and therefore cannot be activated at the same time  Long exposure shots are restricted to 10 seconds maximum  the sensor simply cannot take long exposure  I typically call long exposure at least 1 minute with traditional cameras taking maybe 30 minutes onwards  This is not a fault of the camera as most digital cameras suffer the same fate of  overheated  CCDs  Only the EOD300 can have long exposures  I have seen a 10 minute exposure picture  for a budget camera 10x optical zoom is terrific and even the autofocus at maximum zoom is quick and efficient  A certain knack needs to be adopted with the camera since the shutter trigger is a two position button  A half press will continually focus and a full press will take the picture  therefore if you simply press the button the shutter will appear to be slow since the focusing mechanism will kick in before the picture is taken  If you are anticipating a fast shot then half hold the button to activate the autofocus then the shutter can be activated quickly  Usign this methods the camer was faultless and fast I have never been a fan of megapixels to rate a camera  Rather the resolutions on offer are good and true  2048 scale very well   but dont expect many per a 128Mb card never mind the bundled 16Mb  Colour reproduction is faithful on daylight shots and average for evening shots with maybe a hint of overglow Battery life is great on rechargeables  I got 300 shots from a set of 2100 NIMH before they needed charging and I was using autofocus and zoom a lot  however if you use alkalines then expect 200 before the batteries are drained   note they wont be useless  good enough for remotes or clocks  but they have lost the edge for the drain the camera needs For negative points  the build quality is average  The mechanican shutter jammed on my only 1 week into using it  I couldnt shift between LCD and viewfinder and a heavy press was needed on the back screen to release the shutter  Not good  The battery compartment seems VERY flimsy and I worry about breaking it everytime I use it  and I charge my batteries in a smart charger not internally  No AC supply is included but the majority of people who need one will have a regulated supply to hand anyway The lack of remote function is the only noteable omission from a rather useful bargain camera  
Auto, Last August we finally got rid of our 1984 Chevy Eurosport stationwagon the last of its kind  As I waved  bye bye  and my daughter in law took my picture  no tears came  No way  Because no longer would that sorry looking thing be sitting in my driveway and have me feeling like one of the fiction folks out of the pages of a Carolyn Chutes novel  e g  the Beans of Egypt Maine Yep that Chevy wagon was gone and out of my life forever The next day we picked up a 1999 Mazda SX B2500  bare bones  no frills  no bells or whistles pickup truck  With only 4 cylinders  8 spark plugs inside its engine  I was surprised to find just how peppy this thing really was  Far peppier than the 4 cylinder Ford Pinto wagon my husband and I bought back in the mid 70 s Also no automatic here  We went with the 5 speed standard  Although barebones  it does have an AM FM radio and an air conditioner  The instrument panel has a speedometer  odometer  and indicates fuel  oil  water  amp  battery conditions  Okay so no climate control like my Lincoln  Like I said bare bones       It does have duel airbags and the passenger s side can be turned off  which is advisable if putting in a child s car seat  The airbag can be disconnected via an ignition key inside the cab  An excellent feature not only for a child but also for someone like me who is on the short and petite side  and not much bigger than some children are  Oil changes are recommended every 5 000 miles  Tune ups not necessary for at least 100 000 miles  This little bare bones pickup is fairly inexpensive to drive  as gas mileage is approximately 20 miles to a gal  A plus for those living here in the Northeast  especially with Connecticut getting hit hard with both rising gas prices  1 50 gal  and heating oil costs  last fill up cost me  256   1 75 gal  The lowest octane rating is recommended when you do fill up  The ride is fairly comfortable unlike my Lincoln Continental  which has spiffy load levelers to stabilize the ride and costs  500 apiece when they do give out   I ll save that for another review  I don t expect anything like this to happen any time soon with this Mazda  Besides what do the cost of shock absorbers run for now  I m sure no where near  500  Other features on this  bare bones  model are intermittent wipers  non locking tailgate  which has side rails and positions for tie downs  Four hooks for tie downs inside the bed and also slots for chrome tie downs on top of the rails  Fourteen inch tires that come with steel wheels  We bought snow tires and so far have had no problems getting around on snow covered roads  Certainly  this pickup does not have all the bells and whistles but at  11 000 we hope to have this thing running just as long as that 1984 Chevy wagon  which we had also bought new  And when I make the monthly payments on this truck  there is no interest attached to these payments  Recommended for anyone who wants dependable transportation in a pickup truck     
Camera, I bought the camera over 6 months ago and have taken over 1500 pictures  It s a great little camera  My uncle has the Sony Mavica  and while it seems to have some good features  it s much bigger than the Kodak  I like the smaller form factor  The downloading interface is easy  it has USB  and the picture quality  especially outdoors  is great  I would suggest getting a viewfinder on whatever digital camera you buy   the Kodak 240 model has one  The viewfinder is especially helpful when it is bright outside  and you can t see the little digital screen  I am part of a Search and Rescue Team  and use the camera outdoors on my search and rescue practices  I ve dropped it several times  and am pretty rough with it  So far  it has always worked well  even after the falls There only 2 downsides I can think of for the camera  One is that it really sucks down batteries  especially if you review pictures on the digital screen   I d suggest getting more than one set of rechargeable batteries as backups  Also  sometimes when taking pictures indoors  the flash causes a blue glare on the pics  but this usually only happens when the room is pretty dark and the subject is more than about 5 6 feet away The following statement added after 9 months of use Camera still great  but was in the shop for over a month when it just stopped working  Acted like the batteries were dead  but even after replacing the batteries it remained frozen and would not work  My sister has a 280  and the same thing happened to hers  I would suggest purchasing an extended warranty if available br br  
Camera, I bought this because the price was super low at  60  and the brand was kodak  True to its name  this kodak camera gives very good quality pictures  I dont think that for home use you need more than 1 megapixel  minimum resolution needed for 4x6 prints is 640x480  thats about 0 3 megapixel  So at 1 megapixel u can have prints 2 orders greater  Home users should concentrate more on other features  Now this camera features 1  3 picture quality  the lowest quality of 576x432 isnt good enough even for 4x6 print  so is useless  higher and highest quality at 1152x864 are good  the image size is around 300 KB for highest quality  around 150 KB for higher one  and around 50 KB for least one  So on a 16 MB compactflash card  this camera houses a compactflash card slot  you can have around 50 best quality  or around 100 better quality pictures 2  This camera can be hooked to any NTSC TV  TVs found in US  using a video cable thats not available anywhere  except for a few websites  not even Kodak online shop has this video cable   atleast i couldn t find one  the price is very low on the sites its available   around 5 bucks  so can t think of why kodak didn t include it in the original pack  Also this camera can t be hooked to a PAL TV   TVs found in europe and asia  although its canadian version can be  Doesn t matter for an American buyer  but is a negative for an Indian like me  3 Since digital zoom can be taken only at the lowest resolution  its not much  read that  any  use 4 flash can be operated in automatic  on and off mode  This is helpful  Default is auto  so this is actually a point and shoot camera  no settings required 5  shutter speed is fixed  Thats a low  keep the camera too close  and the contrast is too great MOST IMPORTANT 6 Almost everyone here mentions that batteries run out fast  I was very impressed with the performance of Ni MH cells  I bought 4 pairs of Duracell 1800mAh Ni MH AA cells and a duracell charger for 4 AA  or AAA  cells for just  25 from rite aid  So i take turns with 2 pairs  And with each 2 pair i get something like 50 60 photographs  and i use LCD mostly for taking and reviewing the pictures  So i think this is good performance  I guess all that have given negative feedback on battery performance have dealt with alkaline cells  This way i dont need an ac adapter too 7  The PC connectivity is the most negative feature on this camera  It uses an ultra slow serial connection    even more slow on the internal memory     So you have to buy a usb card reader or pc card adapter for faster transfers For the picture quality u can check the page where i have kept my pictures  http www angelfire com weird vivek The first four links lead to thumbnail pages of all the pictures i have taken from this camera MY EXPERIENCE  Use the flash options intelligently and you will get good pictures  in almost all situations  
Camera, I purchased a digital camera to save costs of developing  and storage space  albums  Digital cameras are great for Graphic artists  EBay  auction sellers  web designers  and anyone into photography  I liked this camera because of it s ease of use  ability to zoom  I have the choice between taking color photos  B amp W  and even Sepia  I can add frames to my pictures  it has many great aspects BUT when deleting pictures from the camera  or doing anything to them via the software  is very time consuming  If you fill up a disk  give yourself at least an hour to save and delete them from he camera It also uses A LOT of battery juice  It DOES come with a set of regular batteries  and a set of rechargeable batteries  AND an adapter  which is GREAT  I suggest you get another set so when it drains the batteries and you need to recharge  you have a spare set to interchange The worst thing about this camera  and it may be the same with others  I do not know  There is a few seconds delay  from the time you press the button and the time the picture is taken  Surprisingly enough the delay screws up a lot of pictures  if they re moving  or it s a spur of the moment shot  Best if used to take still shots br br  
Auto, I love my 1998 RAV4  I bought this car 2 years ago because I had recently been divorced and my minivan was about to die  One of my good friends told me I needed a new look since I was no longer married  I tend to do vehicle shopping when I m driving around town  I fell in love with the look of the RAV4 when they first came out  I get about 28 miles to the gallon  I have not had one problem with it  I can honestly say I would not change a thing about the vehicle  This is the perfect vehicle for someone who likes to spend time in the mountains or for someone who spends lots of time in the city  It is a fairly small SUV so if you have more than 2 children I would not recommend it  I recently attended a focus group on SUV s  about half the people attending owned a RAV4 and everyone just RAVVED about their vehicle br br  
Camera, As an advanced amateur committed to Nikon system   three bodies  quite a few lenses and others accesories  but trying to evolve into digital photography and electronic darkroom found that selection of digital cameras is frustrating There are so many around  most with fixed and poor zoom lenses  and most seem designed by electronic designers not by photographers Tried Fuji MX  2900 for a little over 1100 photos over 1 year   nice camera  good manual overrides of automatic functions but miss through the lens viewing and focusing  also fixed lens  pictures OK but not Kodachrome 64 quality Began searching for Nikon system digi SLR  obvious choice is Nikon s but S 1 is  1000 cheaper  has larger image   more pixels    lighter  a little smaller and can take IBM s minidrive  also built in flash  To my knowledge  asides from these two there are no other choices for SLR digital cameras in Nikon system After 200 photos in 2 weeks   like it very much  Pictures even at  quot Normal quot  compression   JPG around 1 2M   are outstanding  at fine   JPG 2 2M average   simply amazing  I think as sharp as best slow Kodachromes and best Nikon non zoom lenses can deliver Actually very little loss by going to Normal JPG compression and with 1 Giga drive that is over 900 shots in drive Pros  Not too heavy  reasonably fast focus  little lag time between triggering and image capture specially with preview screen off Focus even in full darknes A pro or advanced amateur quality digital camera for  4500 with 1Giga drive   add lenses please  Built in flash quite powerful and since you will not leave it home can get you out of many binds  Adjustable ASA and many color balance choice allow optimization of photo   or image Even allows multiple exposures electronically  Cons As any flexible camera  that is with many controls and posibilities  NOT for newcomers  not for point and shooters  Instruction manual fairly good  Nikon has used video on halide cameras to help learn many controls  may be Fuji should do same While it can be fully Auto if you want fully auto camera you may do better with many others Miss having coupling between setting in zoom lens and external flash   as in Halide camera Nikon N90  Miss an spot meter   this is an strange omission since MX 2900 has it  center weighted not same thing Weighted average metering mode works only in full Auto mode  all other modes use only center weighted mode Has an small histogram display but you cannot adjust it Recommended very highly for advanced amateurs into Nikon system  even pros if camera holds up to wear well If you do not have several compatible lenses  get them   this is body only  that is the beauty of this camera Get 1 Giga hard drive and a computer with USB connector  this allows fairly rapid download to computer  temptation with such a large drive is to do all images at full size and minimal compression Get rechargable NiCad AA s 2 sets and do not worry about battery usage br br  
Camera, One Why did I buy this Olympus D 450 Zoom Camera  Well I went to my sales friend first  He suggested several cameras out of my price range and I went home ready to live with my 35 mil  Than I used another friend s digital  it was my first time out with a digital in hand  Wow  60 pictures  Great viewer  No more surprises  I went back to my sales friend we hashed over specs  Was I going to do a lot of camera to hard copy work  No ok for good as you ll ever need Web pics at or under five hundred hard earned bucks  With a 3X zoom  and a standard big storage disc   not 60 but 122 pics  One camera only  The OLYMPUS D 450Zoom  Two You take and retake like a pro and always see what you just shot  TIP  Get a battery recharger and three sets of  quot aa quot  batteries  You ll run out of charge faster than you can shoot your pics  I carry two sets with me on a shoot for 122 pics  Three Great software comes with the OLYMPUS It s called  quot Camedia quot I use CompuPic Pro when working my pics but Camedia is so good in some aspects  that I use it a lot  Four With digital photography you don t do a lot of  quot tricks quot  It s done in your computer  So don t pay more than five hundred bucks  for great pics  The 3x lense is great and you can do acceptable close ups too  Spend your money on good Photo software  Five I use the direct cable hook up for down loading my pics  but a 3 1 2 quot  adapter comes with tha camera for entering your pics through your 3 1 2 quot  drive br br  
Camera, We recently purchased an Olympus 460 Digital Camera  and within a week  the batteries were dead  Dead I tell you  not even able to be revived see related Epinion When we returned it to the retailer  we told them that we could not buy a camera where we would be saving money on film  and processing  and be paying much much more for batteries once a week  and expensive batteries at that So  after much ado  we zeroed in on the Fuji FInePix 1300  It is a good camera  takes a variety of sizes of pictures  and the quality is far from excellent  but  it is good  Serves the purpose of uploading to the web for family  friends  and auction sites  I love how we can now take a shot and instantly send it across the wire to whomever we choose The camera itself is relatively easy to use  but then  I love gadgets of any kind  So  in retrospect  it may be a little difficult to navigate the menu buttons for the novice  but  once you figure it out  it is pretty simple  I love the viewer  but  it does tend to get nose prints on it because of it s poor location  and there is no lense cover yikes  lint lint lint Now  the software that came with it is pretty decent  and even a little bit of fun  for the addicted  however  I am having a heck of a time learning how to download the pics onto the computer I have done it a few times  but it is not simple at all  I consider myself pretty much computer literate  and man  it is making me crazy so  if there are any advisors out there  please advise In any case  I am having fun  and isn t that what it is all about  
Auto, This Ford Super Duty is one hell of a truck  This truck has great power and performance  It out does all of its competitors by far  There is the excellent quality that comes with the Ford name that makes this truck stand above all the rest  Its high quality performance backs up the well trusted name of Ford  The interior on this truck is really nice and the exterior is sharp  Lots of room and comfort with this truck  The Ford F350 Super Duty truck is all and all an excellent buy  I would recommend it to all truck lovers like myself  If you are lookin to buy a truck and are trying to make up your mind  well let me say this truck is great  but if this one isnt for you Check out the rest of the Ford F series  they are all great     
Camera, There is lots to be said about the Sony Mavica FD85  first off this camera is very easy to use and what you do not understand the owners manual contains instructions which are very easy to read and understand  This camera is well worth the  500 just to have the floppy access which saves tons of time  you no longer have to connect your camera to a computer it is as simple as putting the floppy into your computer and all your pictures are there ready to be looked at  This feature is also great because you no longer have to take up precious hard drive space to store pictures with the low price of floppies you just store your disk for later viewing  As for picture quality it has 4 settings you can use and all are great quality for being a 1 3 megapixel in the lowest setting which is still great for viewing on a computer you can fit close to 35 pictures on each floppy which is great  The best feature on this camera definately is the battery life  even with the battery that comes with the camera has close to 2 hours of picture time which compared to all my other digital cameras that ran on AA batteries is unheard of to me and saves lots of money for a little extra money a 4 hour battery can be purchased and i definately will making this buy  The only real downsides to this camera i can say arent major at all 1 is the weight it is a little heavy but technology is heavy second thing is the lens cap gets in the way which is just a neucsence more than anything  Well you heard my view on this camera and i am a regular person using this not a computer pro i hope this helps in your decision  Thankyou for your time 
Auto, I love Fords and was ready for a sports car  It is a sporty car and gets decent gas mileage  16 in town  27 on highway  I never had any problems with the car It is a smooth riding car and has plenty of room in the front for two people  The back is comfortable for two adults short distances and for two children any distance The car really proved itself to me when I was hit head on by another car  We were both travelling 55mph  The passenger area held together well and both airbags deployed  I was wearing a seatbelt and not seriously injured  Although the car was considered totaled  it proved its worth to me when I was able to walk away from that wreck  Most people don t think sports cars are safe  but the Mustang to me is  I would not hesitate to recommend this car for anyone My car was an automatic with power door locks  power windows  dual airbags  keyless entry  and an alarm  I never had problems with any of these features  The only time I had the car in the garage was for normal oil changes It is definitely not a family car  but a nice safe car for a single person who wants a sporty looking car  It is reliable and not an expensive car  It is definitely lacking in room on the inside  but again  it is not a car you need to buy if you need lots of room  I would recommend this to anyone  
Camera, I recently purchased the Olympus C 2500L and have some familiarity with digital cameras  We all know this is where photography is going  so you might as well get on board  This camera is the cutting edge today  It s expensive  prices will come down  but this camera gives you a 5x7 picture that is indistinguishable from a 35 mm print  I could tell a difference at 8x10 size  This camera has a real zoom lens  most digitals do not  It offers two forms of memory storage  Smartmedia and CompactFlash and has a great versatile flash unit  On the down side  the viewfinder gives you less than what is actually stored  I m guessing 80 90  so you have to make some mental adjustments  The controls are great and very easy to use  In short  it gives you all the promises of digital  real photographic control in your own home  Tell all your friends with computers   digital has arrived and this is the first camera worth the jump br br  
Camera, Searching for a digital camera can be a nightmare  and I spent the last year trying to find a camera with all the features I wanted at a price I could afford  I have had a  beginner  digital camera for three years now  While it was high end when I got it  it is now  novice  level and was beginning to give up the ghost  It was time to invest in a new digital camera  and I knew exactly which features I wanted  Unfortunately  these didn t coincide with my price range  until I found the  Toshiba PDR M5    The Toshiba PDR M5 is a megapixel digital camera  offering all of the features I wanted for a bargain pricetag  If you are shopping for a digital camera  I would suggest that you approach this scientifically  as the vast number of offerings can just overwhelm you when you start looking  Also set out your price range   what you are willing to spend  and what you absolutely cannot go over  budget wise  My criteria  when I was shopping  included  Megapixel   high resolution  Zoom capability  2x minimum  USB Connection  Strongly preferred  Menu Driven  Easy to use  Fast processing  Smartmedia card included  strongly preferred  AC Cord included   Rechargeable batteries  strongly preferred  All accessories included that I need  Total Price Under  400  Refurbished okay if warranted After looking at the features of dozens of different brand digital cameras  I was  quite frankly  overwhelmed and more than a little confused  It was hard enough to compare features within a brand  but comparing several cameras of different makes and models  Almost impossible  there are so many different things to consider and minor variations  I finally made up my checklist  above  and started going through all of the options and suppliers  I ll describe the camera itself  then take you through my criteria and the specifications of the PDR M5 step by step here b Physical Appearance and Features  The camera has a silver body  and measures about 5  wide x 3  high x 2 8  deep  and weighs only 11 3 oz  without the battery or Smartmedia card  On the front there is the lens  which protrudes from the silver case  an optical viewfinder  and ergonomic grip with a rubber finger rest  On the top is a pop up flash  shutter button and the mode dial  On the back is the LCD display  a backlit data display  zoom controls  menu display macro delete buttons  a rocker button to navigate through the controls with  serves as an enter button also  and the flash timer and image quality control buttons  On the bottom are the battery compartment and the tripod adapter  On one side is the door for the Smart Media card  which locks shut  and on the other side is a rubberized flap that covers the USB connector  AC jack and NTSC out jack   Mega Pixel   High Resolution  This camera has a 2 14 megapixel 1600 x 1200  or 800 x 600  resolution  I generally use it in the lowest  basic  mode  there are three  sizes  available and I found the 1600 x 1200 images to be far too huge  The image quality even at the lowest settings is fabulous  crisp and clear b Zoom Capability  This camera has a 3x optical zoom which is equivalent to a 38  115 mm lens  The zoom extends out when in use  and retracts back into the camera when not in use or the camera is turned off  There is also a 2x digital zoom feature  It is worth noting that the lens area sticks out from the rest of the camera all of the time  and is covered with a lens cover when not in use  One fun feature is a 2 5 playback zoom  which lets you look more closely at pictures in the playback mode b USB Connection  This may be a petty point  but it was important to me personally  I have several little gizmos attached to my computer and hate kneeling down  trying to switch out the connection for my camera on the back of my computer when I need to change to another input  The USB cord is great  I can just leave it connected all of the time and plug it into my camera to download when needed b Menu Driven  It was important to me to be able to see  at a glance  exactly what the controls and settings were  I wanted an LCD display  standard on most digital cameras today  that made it very simple for me to set the camera and use it without a lot of squinting at tiny keys  trying to remember which combination to push together  etc  This camera s menu is great  There is a single button  clearly labeled  Menu  that I push to bring up the menu  From my menu  I can control the record mode  all settings  self timer  LCD settings  image quality  flash mode  sounds  time  language  playback settings  etc  There are also several buttons that accomplish some of these features if you don t want to do this all on screen  however  I find it simple and easy to just scroll through the menus and select the options I want  and see them confirmed on screen b Easy to Use  In addition to being menu driven  I wanted a camera that wouldn t baffle me when I picked it up  Bear in mind that I used to sell medical equipment  so I m not afraid of technical products  Nonetheless  I like a camera I can pick up and understand in a matter of minutes  without spending hours reading manuals or having to read the manual four times just to figure out how to shoot a basic picture The PDR M5 has been outstanding in this area  It is clearly set up  with buttons clearly marked  the on screen displays and a mode dial on the top  The mode dial allows you to select whether you want manual mode  where you control the settings and focus  automatic  autofocus  off  playback or PC download mode  There is a detent at each option so it s easy to turn the dial to the correct setting  and a rubber bezel around the outside so it s easy to grip  There is also a little status display  a data LCD screen  right next to the optical viewfinder that is visible even when the image LCD display screen is off  This shows you the battery level  smart media card state  time  current picture settings and number of pictures remaining  I find myself referring to this all the time b Fast Processing  Many people forget that Toshiba is a computer company  and a relatively new entrant to the digital camera market  Their first digital cameras were purchased and relabeled with the Toshiba name  only with the PDR M4 did Toshiba put their own electronics inside  The ultra fast processing speeds on the M5 reflect this  with what is called the  fastest consumer level digicam on the planet  It takes about 2 seconds to boot up at full resolution  and between  8 and 2 seconds between pictures  Of course if you really needed faster pictures than that there is a burst mode available that gives you 4 to 16 shots per second b Smart Media Card Included   I wanted either a smart media card or floppy disk capability  with the media included in my price  The Toshiba PDR M5 price includes a 8 Mb smart media card  which allows me to take up to 128 pictures  at the lowest resolution  on one card  There is a 9 Mb internal memory  however  this is only for buffering the pictures and there is no internal storage  which surprised me  but is fine now that I understand that  There is also a Smart Media card adapter that is optional  this lets you put the smart media card right into your floppy drive    AC Cord and Rechargeable batteries  One of the things that I disliked about my previous camera  the Vivitar Vivicam 2700  see my review at http research epinions com elec review 2B65 5B6730 38922400 prod4  was that it literally ate batteries  When the LCD screen was on it almost inhaled batteries  even off I could rarely get more than 30 40 images on a four pack of batteries  The PDR M5 has three answers to that dilemma  First is the inclusion of a 5v AC adapter  so you don t have to use your batteries for fixed image shooting and playback downloads  I had to order my adapter for the Vivicam separately and it ran about  40  Secondly  the battery is a rechargeable lithium  3 7v 1100mah LiIon  battery pack  included  that lets you take about 160 pictures with the viewfinder on  or 240 pictures with the LCD screen off  I ve never let it run all the way down  but it shows about half charged at 60 80 images left and I generally use the flash and the LCD screen  The battery recharges right in the camera in about five hours  if fully discharged  There is an optional external battery charger that is supposed to be far faster  one hour charging time  and for longer excursions I d recommend an extra battery pack as well  Finally you can turn the LCD screen off and this will save power consumption as well b All accessories included that I need  After my experience with the Vivicam  I wanted to be sure I didn t have to spend a lot of extra money  after  my purchase to complete my set  The PDR M5 came with everything I needed  although there are some optional accessories I am still considering  The camera ships with  Camera  rechargeable lithium ion battery  AC power adapter  8 Mb Smart media card  shoulder hand strap  CD ROM  instruction manual  warranty card  serial cables  NTSC video cables  USB cable and lens cap cover  The Rebate form was downloaded from the Toshiba website    Extra Features I didn t Expect  As I said  this camera met my requirements  In addition  there were several other features that were above and beyond my requirements  and of course I m thrilled with them  although I haven t figured them all out  These include  Lens Cap Cover   a lens cap cover that covers the  protruding  lens  It is attached by a strap to the camera so you don t lose it  Movie Capability   this camera has the capability of making short videos  without sound  This amazed me  at this price  The maximum size for any one movie is 8 MB  and time ranges from 30   120 seconds depending on the resolution required  The image quality is lower in movies  full size   320 x 240 and half size   160 x 120 pixels  but it s a fun feature and great to watch  Black and White images   this was a surprising feature that I didn t even realize this camera had until I read the manual  I have many times that I d like to get a nice black and white photo  especially for corporate presentations or business use  The PDR M5 has an ISO setting that lets you adjust the sensitivity from  the equivalent of ISO  100 to 200 to 400 to Black and White    Burst Multi Image Settings   In the Burst mode  you can take 4 to 16 photos per second  These are not sent to the card but are stored in memory  after the burst you select which ones you want and store them to the smart media card  This is a nice mode for a moving object or for kids like mine  who smile and run  This way I can usually get at least one good picture  There is another mode called multiple images that lets you take 16 continuous shots  4 per second  All of the images are saved as one full sized image  This is nice for moving subjects  and my nephew used it to photograph a horse jumping  You cannot  however  use a flash on burst or multi photography  Bulb Mode   This is a long exposure mode for taking pictures that require several seconds to photograph  An example would be pictures of fireworks at night  You cannot use the flash for this mode either  You can adjust it from 1 second to 8 seconds open  Self Timer   a simple but nice feature allowing you to take pictures on a timer  You can set the timer for either a 2 second or 10 second delay  and can make movies with the timer as well  Macro   a close up mode  allowing the camera to focus on subjects between 1 and 3 feet  Normally subjects this close would be too close to focus on  but in the macro mode I can take pictures as close as 5 inches  such as of my kids  and have them be in focus  This is a really nice feature that I didn t expect to find on a camera in this price range  Manual Mode   If desired  you can set the camera to manual to adjust the white balance  exposure compensation  aperture value and AF AE area  I have to admit that I don t know anything about these features and strongly prefer the automatic mode  but far more skilled photographers would no doubt appreciate this feature  Ergonomic shape   the camera is more or less molded to your hand  so it is easy to grip  with rubber grips and a natural  right handed  shape that conforms to your hand  It is very lightweight and I find it far easier to hold than my previous digital camera and even my fixed Pentax camera  Digital Zoom   allows the center of the image to be enlarged to twice its normal size  so you can more clearly see the image you are recording  This is nice for taking pictures of objects you know you may crop later  but want to select clearly now  Playback Zoom   This is a cool feature that allows you to frame in the area of a picture you want to see  then zoom in on that area during playback  This is great for seeing a small piece of an image that you want to see up close  such as a person s face in a distant shot  This is especially useful for burst photography where you are picking whether or not to save images  or if you are near the capacity of your card and want to decide if you should save or delete an image  3 Mode Display Screen   the LCD screen actually has three options  The first is showing the image  with all of the photographic mode symbols  mode  number of shots left  flash  battery  time  date  etc  The second mode is to show the image without any symbols or mode information  and the third is with the screen off  The first two modes are also available during playback  I have found that the information is useful for my first picture than I find it distracting and turn it off    Additional Lens capability   this camera has an adapter ring attachment on the front  which is a threaded ring  If you wanted to  you could attach an additional lens or optical filter to your camera  Red Eye Mode   The flash can be set in several modes  including automatic  red eye reduction  forced flash  suppressed flash and slow synchro  The slow synchro is good for shooting people at night with a dark background  or where there is a lot of backlighting  etc  White Balance   In the manual mode  you can set the white balance  Options include automatic adjustment  outdoors  bluish fluorescent light  reddish fluorescent light  and incandescent light  My cousin was quite excited to hear that I had these options  although I again admit I always leave the camera set to automatic b  What I m Disappointed In   For the most part I am thrilled with this camera  To be fair  though  there are three things that are disappointing  although I ve learned to work with them  and you should be aware of when you select this camera  These are  Shutter Lag   There has to be a slight lag between when you hit the shutter and when you take the picture  This allows the camera to focus and then take the picture  If you don t allow for this lag  and just hit the shutter all the way  your images may be out of focus  I have learned to work with this but I must admit it s a pain when I have two little rugrats I m trying to photograph   that extra second it takes to focus can make the difference between having them smiling or not  or in the picture or having run off already  In any case you have to partially depress the button to focus before you fully depress the button to take the picture    Off between record  amp  playback   whoever setup the mode dial clearly was more concerned about battery conservation than convenience  The camera has to cycle past  off  to get from  record  to  playback  which is a pain in the rear  I will admit that if you flip it really fast you can usually fool the camera  I like to see the image I just took before I decide if I need another one so I often flip back and forth  It s a minor inconvenience but not one I can t live with  Low Light Focusing Problems   The camera focuses optically  not using an infrared beam  I m not sure if this was to improve the processing speed or what  but it means that the camera has difficulty focusing in low light situations  I ve also had some minor problems with distance focusing  but not as bad  Again these are not horrible issues  and perhaps if I had paid  800 for the camera I would be more upset  but it s a minor inconvenience  Toshiba told me there is a firmware upgrade available but I don t have this yet b  Price   The Toshiba PDR M5 met all of my requirements  and was well within my price range  The retail price for a brand new PDR M5 is  799  but I have seen this on sale online for  599 and up  I bought mine through Ubid for under  400  and there is a  100 mail in rebate as well  This brought my grand total to  296  including shipping   New or Refurbished    My camera was refurbished  but with a 90 day warranty  which is long enough for me to determine if there is any major technical glitch with the camera  I have purchased many electronic items refurbished  and have found that new or refurbished  the average time to discover problems is about 2 3 weeks  If they pass this timeline  the next hurdle doesn t show up for over a year  which generally puts them outside the one year warranty anyway  I have purchased coffee makers  computers  monitors  cameras  and other electronic products refurbished without problems in the past  or  as I said  the problems clearly show up in the first 2 3 weeks of use  which is well within the initial warranty period  You  of course  have to decide how much risk you are willing to take for the savings involved b Summary  After a year of searching  and watching cameras like the PDR M5 come on the market  but far above my price range  I didn t think I would ever find a camera that met my needs  I was shocked to see the PDR M5 on Ubid  and spent several days researching this camera to make sure there weren t any major design flaws I was unaware of  Reassured  I snatched up this gem at a bargain price  I have been incredibly impressed with the quality and delivery of this camera  and with its capabilities  I would recommend this to a friend who was shopping for a camera as a great buy  and hope that I will be using my PDR M5 for many years to come For more

Camera, The Kodak mc3 got me really excited  I searched to find it everywhere when I heard about it  I bought the first one I could find  and with trembling hands took it out of the box  It was soo pretty and compact  I took it everywhere for a week  I had 3 small songs on my memory card and always came home with a card full of photos and small video  It is really fun to play with  I was humming  King of the road  everyday to work  After the 3rd day of use  I had tons of photos that I wanted to load up to the web and impress all of my friends with video clips on my website  I spent the next 2 days working on my photos in photoshop  and editing my video clips to make them longer  cleaner  etc  When I looked at my new photos after  I got discouraged  2 days of work for this  the photos were too small  and blowing them up revealed too many flaws  The let down of thinking you gave a great picture  and then find out that it didn t come out that puts a damper on the spirits  I changed my mp3 s from  King of the road   low rider  and Blur s  song  2  to  Stormy Monday Blues   Jet plane  and John Lee Hooker s  boom boom  Man did I have the blues I went back to Kodak to buy another memory card  Something big and Juicy that would hold a lot of music  I found out that the memory card that I wanted would cost the same as the camera  This is one expensive toy Sadly  after a week  I boxed up my pretty new toy  and handed it back in  I will have to settle for scanning my point and shoot camera and animating rapid photo shoots Yes  it plays mp3 s Yes  it takes digital pictures Yes  it will take video  too All for a good price but if you don t take good pictures  or your video is choppy  you won t like the pictures you take  and the photos look like crap  Given a few years of development  this product will be much better  
Auto, I drive a 95 Nissan Sentra and have never had any type of problems  The ride is very smooth and it gets great gas mileage  When I put the 93 octane in I consistently get 30 mpg  When I put the less expensive gas in  my gas mileage drops to 26 28 mpg  so I don t do that often  I put tons of mileage on my Sentra because I am a pet sitter  I will reach the 100 000 mile mark in March probably and the only thing I have had to do is replace a starter  Other than that I just keep the oil changed  I don t know anything about cars and don t want to have to know about cars  That is why I bought a Sentra  When we were looking for a truck for my boyfriend one of the salespeople noticed our Sentra  We told him this was our work car and he said   quot Well you couldn t have picked a better one  them Nissan s run like they re possessed by the devil quot  He said they will just never die  Pretty good recommendation from a guy at a Ford dealership  huh The only con I can think of is because of the smaller engine my Sentra doesn t have a lot of pick up  This has never been a problem for me but I have noticed that whenever a man has had a reason to drive my car they have complained about this I would urge anyone who has to have a dependable vehicle and doesn t want to have to do anything except keep gas in the tank and the oil changed to get a Sentra br br  
Auto, I first saw what was to become the XG 300 at the Philadelphia Auto show in 1999  It was then called the Equus  I looked curiously at this large  for a Hyundai  car sitting on the platform and was disappointed that it was for show only  you could not sit in it  The next year  it had changed names and was available for inspection  I was immediately impressed with the long list of standard features and the sticker price just knocked me out  This year  with the 0  financing  I decided to take a test drive  I am glad that I did  It turned me on to an incredible value  that I am appreciating more with each day I drive it  Front and side air bags  traction control  pre tensor seat belts   they tighten to hold you against the seat in a collision  and 4 wheel ABS Disc brakes make safety one of the big reasons I bought this car  These are standard yet some of these items are not even offered on other makes in this price range  The 5 speed automatic transmission is the smoothest shifting one I have ever had the pleasure to drive  Slip it into the  manual  gate and you can control the shift points to give a sportier feel  Even in the  manual  gate  however  you cannot overrev the engine or upshift to too high a gear to make the engine drag  as it is electronically blocked  Shifts while cornering while in  D  come a bit late  so if you like to push it through the corner a bit  you will definitely need to use the manual gate  The engine itself is extremely quiet during normal acceleration and cruising  even at 70 mph  but exhibits a slight growl under hard acceleration  not at all unpleasant  though  This certainly is not the fastest car on the block  but it is more than adequate for most drivers  The flip side to that is that gas mileage is pretty good for a car of this size  I am averaging in the low to mid 20 s in suburban driving  The 2002 will have a 3 5 liter 194 hp engine upgrade  Ride quality is more to the highway cruiser type  hardly a pothole or bump will jar you  Handling is a bit mushy due to this  comparable to my Chrysler Town   Country minivan  The complaint about the  little  wheels has been rectified  as the XG300 now comes with standard 16  wheels  Michelin tires  I have read some of the other reviews here  and wonder if these people have actually driven the car  One complained of  tight head room with the moon roof  I am 6 5  and usually have trouble fitting into cars of Asian descent  This is the only one I have sat in with a moon roof that I can actually fit in with no problems  My head does not touch the roof liner even with the moon roof liner closed  Leg room is adequate for me  and someone can actually sit behind me in the back seat  The 6 way adjustable power seat is very comfortable  but lacks enough lateral support for hard cornering  The leather is nice and smells good to me   I don t know where they got the  plastic fumes  from  In fact the interior in general is well put together  The trip computer is kind of useless  giving miles until empty and miles driven as the only useful information  I don t really care about average miles per hour or elapsed time  and would have appreciated gas mileage readings  not included  The miles driven is redundant with the trip odometer on the dash  Climate control is very nice  keeping the car either warm or cool accurately  but somewhat confusing to use  Air can be fresh or recycled or automatically determined by computer  the confusing part  if fumes are present  I still haven t quite figured out what that means  Passenger seat is 4 way power adjustable and both seats are heated   standard on  L  which with leather in a cold climate you really do need  they get very cold to sit on  The  mist  button on the end of the wiper stalk is a nice touch that allows one sweep of the windshield during light rain  The driver power seat will fully retract when the engine is turned off to allow easy entrance and exit  and return to the previous setting upon starting the car  There are 2 presets for the seat and mirrors available   on  L  version this is standard  Electrochromic rearview mirror is standard  automatically adjusts for day night electronically  I probably missed some items  but the list is very long  I bought the XG300L version and most everything is standard  With moon roof  heated seats and a long list of standard items on the  L  plus every option available  wind shield for moon roof  cargo net  8 CD changer  and pin stripping the car listed for around  27 000  I paid  23 500 with 0  financing for 5 years  For  660  I got the extended warranty for 10 year  100 000 mile bumper to bumper coverage   usually 5 year  60 000 mile  which is then also transferable to a new owner  You cannot come close to matching that with any other car  I think it is a nice looking car  but that is subjective to each person  and the quality seems to be there so far  I am extremely impressed the fit and finish at this point  I highly recommend this car to anyone who can look beyond the prestige factor of some brand names  
Camera, First things first  if you re looking for a digital camera to replace your traditional 35 mm  this is not the camera for you  However  if you re looking for a simple camera to quickly capture an image or two to attach to an email or use in an online auction  this may do the trick While the image quality isn t particularly good and transferring pictures to your PC can be a bit quirky  the camera does work decently  It s also one of the few cameras in it s class with a flash  so inside photography is also supported While the MSRP is around  80  the camera can be often be had at many online stores  w shipping  coupons  etc  for under  40  At this price it provides decent functionality without forcing you into a multi hundred dollar outlay br br  
Camera, Design Very compact  easy to use and good looking camera Picture Quality Outdoor  Excellent in all weather conditions  sunny  cloudy   Indoor  Very good  if reminding the flash range 1 5m 2 5m Flash The flash range is very limited  1 5m 2 5m  If your subject is out of this range  this will cause over  or under exposure When using the flash  you have to keep your fingers on the grip  Holding a finger somewhere between the grip and the lens will cause reflections towards the lens  resulting in hazy images Storage The internal memory stores 6 to 30 images  depending on the resolution The camera has a Compact Flash Slot  so you can expand the memory as you prefer WebCam Very good quality Very handy with the included camera mount Pricing Very affordable camera  
Auto, Please read Mkaresh s post Yes Bubba  It is a truck  before reading this post  as this post is in reply to his excellent review of the X5  I decided to post this as a review since it became kind of long for a comment response to his review Mkaresh  I largely agree with your post  I own a 528i wagon see my review  and it IS a better handling and bigger  cargo space vehicle than the X5 BUT  cars appeal to peoples emotions as often as their sensibilities  I drove a X5 with the 4 4L engine and it definitely has emotional appeal in spades  Let s face it  most people worry about how they will look in a car above all else  Especially in this market segment  And the X5 looks GOOD  Also  the interior is like no other that I ve seen stunning I agree that it is a compromise vehicle  And I like the wagon more for its extra space and better ride and handling  But if I didn t need the extra space  weren t such a driving enthusiast  and wanted something that said something about my position in life loudly and with flair  I could do much worse than the X5  Lastly  regardless of any compromises  this thing is a BMW  Forget the image  forget the prestige  put your ego aside  To me there is ONE reason to spend this kind of money on a vehicle  Because it is an incredible engineering achievement  You feel it in every shift  through every corner  and approaching every stop light  You feel it when you open the door and get in  and you feel it when you employ any of its features  It is automotive genius  and thus any BMW is a bargain to those with the means br br  
Camera, This camera is great for home use  It works as a webcam as well as a still cam  It shoots pictures at 640x480 resolution and the pictures are very high quality  I love the CF slot  The only thing is that it s max is 32 MB  I use a CF card all the time and can then take it out and insert it into my pda and view the pictures anywhere  I had a little trouble installing the drivers on my Windows XP machine  but finally got it to work  It DOES have flash  contrary to what the main page says  The internal memory is 8 MB of RAM  The problem with RAM is that once it loses power  the data is lost  BUT  they have included a backup battery so that as long as your backup battery is good  you can change your batteries without loss of data  I personally just use my Compact Flash card since it doesn t require power to retain data and since I can view the pictures on my PDA  
Camera, The Hewlett Packard Photo Smart C200 Digital Camera is a budget conscious wonder of engineering  I was able to unpack the camera  load the batteries and take pictures within 10 minutes  Crystal clear digital images are possible that would amaze the avocational 35MM buff  and the graphic delivery certainly is more than adequate and convenient for internet uploading  My background in conventional photography would typically find me suspicious of the range possible within the digital arena  however I m encouraged with the future of digital photography if Hewlett Packard was able to develop such a respectable platform at such a reasonable price  The purchaser should be aware of several limitations  I found that the C200 delivers the most effective results when photos are taken on the  quot Super Fine quot  setting  The camera offers three settings  with progressive improvements in the image  according to the numbers 1 2 or 3  three being optimum  The finer the setting logically the less photos can be stored in the memory card  however this is not a large concern  since the photos can be easily downloaded and the memory card reused  Digital cameras  suck the life  out of batteries  so rechargeable batteries and battery charger are a good secondary investment  Unfortunately the HPC200 does not come with an AC Adapter  although one is available separately  The adapter  sold separately  is  pricey  and fairly specific as far as it s electrical configuration  so the wise consumer may want to avoid a generic model that may damage the camera  Finally  and at the low price point this drawback may be forgiven  the manual lighting settings are awkward to manage  since they are arbitrary arrow buttons that cause the photo to become gradually lighter or darker     
Auto, The new Chevrolet Malibu is a family sedan for people like me who hate family sedans  It offers the convenience of four doors without the  quot boxy quot  look  the model with the rear spoiler is particularly sporty The Malibu is comfortable  roomy and handles like its more expensive European counterparts  The steering and suspension are direct  with none of that mushy feeling on the road  It s nicely powered as well  when you step on the gas  this car moves  Personally  I think they ve done a far better job with this car than the Alero  which I ve driven  It handles better  is more comfortable and is easier on gas  The Malibu is available with all the toys at a relatively modest price  fully equipped with leather interior  sun roof and a CD sound system in the low to mid twenties in Canada  In my opinion  the Malibu is proof that American car manufacturers CAN build a car to compete with Japanese and European family sedans and I hope we will see more such cars in the future     
Camera, First  let me start off by saying the the Camera is not horrible but not worth its value either PICTURE   The picture quality of the DC4800 is not nearly up to the standards of other 3 megapixel cameras of even less price  I was disappointed with the printable results at even sizes like 5 by 8  At 8 by 10 the picture become pixelated  While that camera s photographs look excellent on the computer  when printed the result is disappointing  I even have a professional photograph printer and the photos are just so so   LCD FUNCTION MENU   The interface of this camera is wonderful  I really like the speed in which you can access basic function  however  the display itself is not up to par and displayed images appear lined and pixelated SPEED   the camera is by far one of the slowest cameras that i have ever used  It takes seemingly forever to initilize  PROBLEMS   the LCD of this camera is encased by a metal framing  This framing on my camera began to crack very early on  The cracks encompasses the entire display  Let me make my self VERY clear that i am excessively protective of my equipment and have never dropped  impacted  or forced this camera in any way and the cracks continue  I did some research and hundreds of other have had the same cracking  Sadly  Kodak just IGNORES the problem and accuses the consumers of misuse  Lets think about this folks  Hundreds of people have the same issue at the same place hummm  must be an act of God not covered by the company CONCLUSION   Please do not waste you money   
Camera, I got this camera for about  50 on ebay  it retails for around  140  and have been very happy with my purchase  I ve been wanting to try out a digital camera for some time now  but don t have the  300  to buy a really nice one  This camera is small and easy to pack and takes pretty good pictures  provided the lighting is alright  It comes with some good software as well The main thing this camera lacks is a stronger flash  Unless the subject is right in front of you the flash doesn t do much for you  I recommend using this camera for mainly outdoor events  The camera is supposed to double as a video conferencing camera as well  I haven t had much experience using this part of the camera  or other video conferencing units  so i don t have much to say on the subject  I got a very poor  sluggish image but i m trying to figure out if that is my computer s fault or the camera s fault  All in all i m very pleased with my purchase  Its quality has surpassed what i was expecting when i bought the inexpensive camera  It has served its purpose in helping me decide if i want to move on to a more expensive digital camera  or just stick with my 35mm  
Camera, This thing is  blue  and I  LOVE  it  I was looking for a good but cheep digital camers  There were a few things I wanted  an LCD screen as well as am optical view finder  and removalble memory and I was led  By AOHell  to the AGFA EPhoto 780C  I decited  quot What the heck quot  and ordered it  here are my impressions b Pros    b ITs  Blue  I thought   quot A blue camera quot  But it is fun to have a blue camera  makes it super easy to identify as mine quot    b So so pictures While I wouldn t expect a pro taking pictures for a magazine to use this the photos are good enough for me  Mabey some day when I have more money I will buy a better camera    b 2 View finders This has both a LCD and Optical view finder  so you can conserve batteries by using the optical view finder  but still go through and see your photos    b Easy to use This thing couldn t be  ANY  easier to use  It operates almost just like a normal camera b CONS    b Eats batteries for breakfast If you want this camera make sure you buy some high capacity rechargable batteries to go with it  you ll need them    b Plan on spending more then you thought This camera doesn t stop at  299  You ll be buying batters more than you expected and if you plan on taking more then a couple decent photos plan on buying more memory  although it will only accept memory cards up to 8Mb  Also if you want your photos on your computer anytime soon you will probably end up buying a Digital Film reader  the searial port methood is  SLOW b    b Not extremly high res Although it takes nice photos for your computer and for small  standard size prints don t expect megapixel performance br br  
Camera, A digital camera is a huge purchase for most of us  and one purchase where you don t want to go wrong  We researched cameras for weeks  comparing features and abilities  and this is the one we bought  We ve never regretted it  Here s what sold us B  USB Compatible  b  I can t stress enough how important this is  If you have  or will one day have  USB  you have to get a camera that supports it  We re talking mere seconds for downloads of large graphic files  instead of minutes B  Rechargeable Battery  b  Plug it in and juice it up  Why throw away money on batteries  You can even use it while it s charging  This is a must feature  it will save you countless dollars  Charges quickly  maybe an hour for from 0  to 100  charge B  LCD  b  Yes  you can live without it  but why  See your pictures instantly  and delete the ones you don t like so you can take more  This may use extra battery life  but take the plug in charger with you and it won t matter  An LCD display lets you keep only the photos you want  which is important if you have limited disk space B  Zoom  b  You know why this is important  What s cool is that you can also zoom in on the LCD screen and see all areas of your photo in close up  This will show you if the photo is fuzzy or crisp  and let you see facial expressions  even in group photos B  Image Expert Software  b  By far the best software we ve come across  You can use the Quick Fix feature and then go in and sharpen  deepen  and add color  we like more blue in our photos  Also  this software has a great screen saver option   just select an album as your screen saver and you re done  Makes it easy to update the photos  too B  Video  b  You can actually take videos with this camera   no sound  but it s still fun  The movies go up to 60 seconds  We have captured the first time our infant batted at a toy with his foot  his funny faces while tasting new foods  and even my husband getting 2 ringers while playing horse shoes  We also got some awesome shots of lightning  and you can freeze the panes  but I haven t figured out how to turn those panes into photos  if you even can  You do have to switch modes when recording and viewing videos  which is a little bit of a pain  but not a huge deal  Another nice feature   you can turn off the sound  This matters to us because our little guy would stop whatever he was doing when he heard the camera  and we d miss the shot This is a great looking camera and it comes with lots of accessories   recharger  USB cable  strap  lens cover  and 8 meg card  I d definitely recommend getting at least a 32 meg card  too  about  60 when we got ours  64 meg cards are out there or coming soon  and this is noted as being upgradeable to 128 megs by firmware  which is yet another plus The camera didn t come with a case and doesn t fit in most  it s 3  thick  which is too big for most cases we tried  but we found a nice ICON one that holds the camera and accessories and is still small enough that it doesn t feel like you re hauling around a video camera We ve noticed only 2 down sides  first  in some lighting  usually soft yellow lights  like those our living room  it s hard to get clear shots  My brother has this camera too  and says he has learned to manipulate the flash so this isn t an issue  my husband and I haven t taken the time to investigate our photography taking as much as my brother has  we just point and shoot and mostly get great pictures  The second thing is that the rubber guard protecting the recharger  USB and serial ports tore off after about a year  We can still affix it to the camera but it is no longer permanently attached  this was truly the only part of the camera that could be considered flimsy  and the guard itself wasn t  just the bottom where it attached For technical info  the official Toshiba site is here http www toshiba com taisisd dsc products cameras pdrm5 index htm And the lowdown from a site that our guru brother in law has said is one of the best  when it comes to digital camera reviews http www steves digicams com toshiba pdrm5 html We got this camera during a Toshiba promotion offering  100 rebate  so our bottom line was about  550  The list is  799 but Yahoo Shopping currently shows a few stores that have it under  400  One is listed here  I know nothing about this store  but the price is good so it might be worth investigating   the page says they don t sell any gray market or refurbished items http shop store yahoo com pc4nothing pdr m5 html We ve taken thousands of photos and are extremely pleased with this camera  I recommend it to everyone  
Auto, I own a Chevy Camaro and it was the smartest thing I ever did  It seems they have more  and more horsepower every year  My Camaro hugs the road like a sports car  I have the classic v 8 and it uses the gas of a smaller sedan  I ve never had to take it to the shop and it starts the first time every time  If you want to pull out and pass with the Camaro  you ll have no problems   It accelerates very quickly and all you have to do is come out of over drive into drive and let it take over br br  
Camera, I was searching for a digital camera to be able to use with my model horse hobby  I happened to find the PDC 640 at Walmart at the price of  178 00  Too nice a price to pass up  I purchased one and took it home  The camera itself is extremely easy to use and takes very nice pictures  Problems I have found are  even with the flash  you need a lot of light to take indoor pictures  No zoom feature on this camera makes taking pictures of tiny objects  such as 3 inch model horses  difficult  All in all  though  I have been fairly happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone wanting a digital camera br br  
Auto, Got my 97 Grand Am GT brand new and so far no major problems after 34 500 miles  Recently the  quot check engine quot  warning light came on and I took the car to the dealer for a diagnostic check  Upon the check  no problem was detected  The car was running fine  All they did was to clear the warning code  not repair work done  Their speculation was a computer glitch  To my dismay  I was charged  93 for the check with no actual repair work nor any part replaced  I told the dealer that I strongly felt that it should be covered by warranty  Guess what  GM really did their probability homework  My warranty expired 2 months ago  just barely  but mileage was still less than the 36 000 miles normal warranty mileage  I had no choice but paid the stiff charges for one simple test  Called the Pontiac Customer Assistance Center to voice my concern  but naturally  I lost  I guess I need to start a trust fund account to pay for the next erroneous  quot check engine quot  warning indication  another  93  Oh  by the way  read your warranty carefully next time when you purchase a car  The Federal Emission Warranty has been reduced to 24 000 miles  not the 5 years 50000 miles prior to 1994     
Camera, When you power the camera up  it takes about 3 seconds to warm up before it s ready to shoot  Once it s ready  you push the shutter down halfway to lock the autofocus and then depress the shutter fully  Now you have a pic  You can review it on the LCD if you want any where from 2 to 10 seconds  The LCD screen measures 1 5 inches and fairly clear and easy to see but it would have been nice to control the brightness Next move inside to take some flash pictures  Here you ll use the autofocus illuminator to help the camera focus in low light  There s a small orange light on the front of the camera under the flash  when you focus  it comes on to make it easier for the camera to focus  This eliminates the long focus times that some other camera have in these situations if they can even focus at all  Also inside  you ll appreciate the fact that Canon put a decent flash on this little guy  It has a working distance of about 13 feet at the wide angle setting Picture Quality is very good  Pictures come out sharp with accurate color tones  I do get red eye sometimes in indoor shots but  not always and  not to the point that I would consider unacceptable  Software  etc Canon supplies you with two software applications  One their own and the other is ArcSoft s  Both applications are good for basic image editing but  if you want something more you ll likely use Photoshop Downloading photo s is pretty straight forward once the software is installed  Hook up the computer with the supplied cable to a USB port  flip the mode switch  turn it on  and your computer  PC  will either open the appropriate program or  you ll have to  Once the program is open  pick the images you want and  hit File  Transfer  That s about it  You can also view images  and movies on a TV with the supplied cable The only other things in the box  aside from the manual  are a 16MB Compact Flash card and  4 AA batteries  In the highest resolution  you ll get 8 pictures on this card so  you ll probably want to also purchase a 12x 256mb Lexar online for  50  The 4AA batteries will last about 100 pics so  consider purchasing  30 Rayovac 15min rechargeables also  The batteries and the CF card will set you back about another  80 but  you ll thank yourself later  I would recommend these for anyone purchasing a digital camera  
Camera, I bought this camera for two reasons 1  Its a Kodak  This is a respected name and I felt certain that I would get a good product  2  It came highly recommended by a friend in the computer industry whom I highly respect  Armed with this knowledge and a receipt so I could return the camera if it failed to meet my expectations  I just marched in  grabbed one off the shelf and bought it  What I got was far more then I expected  Just point and click and you have a remarkable image  This is the most basic application  From there you begin to experiment and find that you can organize your photos user defined folders  There are several focusing methods  Light and White balance are selectable or automatically controlled   its up to you  Cool bells and Whistles  Select text and or date to appear on each photo  Built in audio recording and playback for each photo  Use your camera like a video camera for your computer  i e  internet phone or web camera  This list goes on Downsides  There a couple of problems but they seems to be inherent to the digital camera world not just to the Kodak DC series  Unless you buy the AC adapter you will be spending a lot of time and money changing batteries  And unless you purchase the optional parallel uploading device you will be spending a lot more time waiting for images to upload via the asynchronous port  The USB interface is faster and better then asynchronous data transfer  but the wait time is still somewhat painstaking  What I found best about this product though is NOT the bells and whistles but the quality of picture I got  We are talking about pixel density that my monitor could not display  With the right printer  I use the Epson Color Stylus 850 1440x750dpi  and  photo quality paper you can truly get amazing clarity photo printouts  In conclusion and to sum it all up I would have to say  Kodak   Way to Go  I have had people ask me where I got my pictures taken and blown up to 8 5  x 11  When I tell them I did it with the Kodak DC260 and printed it out in my home office they are blown away   and you will be too br br  
Camera, I began to do some significant research into digital camera a few weeks ago  I began to solicite the opinions from a lot of my friends on which camera would be the best  and overwhelmingly the response was for the Olympus D 340R Digital Camera So I began to research more information on this camera and on the next generation of it   the D 360L I cant say enough good things about this product  On the medium setting   which allows for 36 pictures on the 8 meg SmartCard   both on screen and printed I had a high quality picture  In fact  just printed out of the software from the camera   without ANY doctoring of the image in Photoshop   I was able to get a high quality image straight out of my printer I would spring for the floppy disk adapter when buying this camera  however  The serial adapter that comes with it does not allow for very fast transfers of images  Using the adapter is a breeze As of right now  I am on my first set of AA batteries for this camera  As I am not a huge fan of rechargable batteries  I don t see me using anything OTHER than AA batteries with this camera  I have found this camera very easy to operate     
Auto, I m a Leaser  I like the Write offs  So when I look at for A Car I look for INSTANT gratification  I just got out of a BMW 5 series and was looking to Downsize  Price wise  and this Kind of Bothered me  I wanted Sport but also luxury and I Didn t really want to comprise either  I Test drove BMW s  Mercedes  I even went so far as to drive a Boxster a couple of times  But there I had to compromise  I was getting frustrated and Confused Until  I walked into a Landrover showroom looking for an SUV for my wife  This place also happened to be a Jag dealer and there it was   A Black on Black X Type fully loaded  I had not even considered Jag before but my curiosity got the best of me  The front of the car was   well just plain Gorgeous   the Back however looked   well like a Ford Contour  Talk about mixed emotions  That all went away however once I drove it  Lets address the Interior first  This was a Sport addition and had the Really contoured sport seats  which hugged my body and were so comfortable and accommodating   I m 6 1  230lbs and I m no Body builder  The Gauges were laid out perfectly and the Body of the Car was tight  The Interior Luxuries where all Jaguar and the Connelly Leather sure was soft  It just felt GREAT  Now it was time to drive  I started the car with a Throaty Purr of the 3 0 Inline 6  Just tuff enough sounding to let you know your not in a  cream puff  Jag  This was a Manual Transmission  which is what I was looking for  and it rivaled if not surpassed the Shifting of the BMW  I stepped on the gas and was amazed at the Zippiness  Is that spelled right  of this new Jag  This was a car to Really Drive   It Handle superbly with its all wheel drive and the 17  wheels didn t hurt either  It definitely gave the  I m a sport car  impression  yet stopped at light  you can barely tell the car is running  It was responsive  tight  and yet had a refinement of a JAG  Actually I was a bit surprised at the stiff suspension  I wasn t prepared to feel the bumps in a JAG  Don t get me wrong  I loved it  I just expected a Cushy er  ride  Leaving the Showroom I thought that this car was as nice as my BMW  1 week later when I had to make my decision  I could not get the way that I felt in the JAG out of my head  It coddled you inside and gave you a thrill ride outside  That was my car  I didn t quite get the whole downsizing thing accomplished  Sticker on the one I got was  43 500  But I got a Great deal on the lease and I got them to throw in a couple of service perks  It has now been 1 1 2 months since a drove it out of the dealer and I still cannot get enough of the comfort and sportiness of this car  I m still not 100  sold on the Outside styling but its growing on me and the Tinted windows does wonders  This choice definitely makes me happy  However   I have run into slight somewhat minute problems   The computer controlled Sunroof has not been right since I got the Car   I ve had in twice and expect it to break again  The Airbag warning light keeps flashing also  Other than that  No complaints  If you are looking for a Sporty car with plenty of Speed Luxury  and is truly  at least now  unique  this is the Car for you  
Auto, Where to begin I bought this car on the recommendation of a friend who has a pretty serious love affair with Volvo cars  For the first 5   6 months  the car was fine  But then   Paint Chips  Within the first 10 months  I noticed dime sized paint chips on the front of the car  Unfortunately  I didn t purchase the clear coat auto bra at the time of original purchase  To me  this was totally unacceptable  I took it to my dealer and had to argue with the service director to get it fixed  paint is not warranted  In fact  they wouldn t fix it at first  It was only when I responded to the Volvo service survey with my dissatisfaction that they agreed to fix the paint chips  During my original conversations with Curtis at Rickenbaugh Volvo  he indicated that the problem was likely my fault  asking if I follow other cars too closely Headlights  The headlights go out about every 6 months  Annoying Brakes  The car was in for work on the brakes twice within 34K miles  The power assist on the brakes failed at 15K miles  not so good when you live in the mountains  Then  the rear pads wore out at about 30K miles  Rickenbaugh Volvo Service  Mark or Jim  quoted me  460 to replace the rear brakes  A service guy in Vail  where everything is TWICE as expensive as the real world  charged me  180  and  he told me that I could drive at least another 5K miles on what I had   Volvo made it sound like my car would be unfit for the roads unless I had the brakes replaced immediately Check Engine light  The Check Engine light came on randomly during the two years that I had the car  This light required me to take the car in for service twice Service light  The service light comes on every 7 500 miles  ANNOYING  Last time I took the car in  I asked them to permanently disable the light or set it at 30 000 miles  They said they couldn t do that  which I don t really believe  I mean  c mon  you can disable you Daytime Running Lights and your airbags  but you can t disable the Service light Road Noise  Sounds like your drag racing a Mack Truck when you are on the highway  I took a roadtrip with a friend once  and the wind and road noise on the passenger side were so unbearable  that we had to stuff pillows up against the passenger window to buffer the noise Tires  I needed new tires way too early  25   30K miles  I rotate and balance my tires religiously Back hatch  The plastic molded rear hatch is supposed to be black  After about 10 months  it had oxidized to a cloudy gray  It looked bad  And  the button you press to open the hatch was cracked  I estimate in about another year  it will break off completely Handling in Snow  Forget about it  This car was sold to me as a car that would perform well in the snow  I ve never gotten stuck  but I have definitely had some concerns on snowy days  Bottom line  The car was in for service 7 times in two years  Twice  the Volvo dealer  Rickenbaugh Volvo in Denver  made a smirky  smart alek comment about how the problems were the fault of my driving  paint chips  I must follow too closely  Brakes pads wearing out  I must brake too hard  Funny  I never had problems like that with the previous cars I ve owned  a Honda Civic for seven years and a Chevy Blaze for three years Gimme a break  I wouldn t recommend this car  any Volvo  or Rickenbaugh to my worst enemy The best part of the story is that on the last service survey  I gave Volvo Rickenbaugh the poorest rating possible  and they never called me back  I guess they are content to just blow off my bad experience Really  it no longer matters  I traded in this unreliable and chattering car for a Honda just this week  
Auto, I purchased this car about 8 months ago and must say I am totally pleased with it  I had a 2000 Honda Civic EX before but needed something with 4 doors and having the rear hatch sold me on the Spectra  With the rear seats folded down there is plenty of room for cargo  I am not here to bash the Civic but I have to say that overall the Kia outperforms the Civic easily  That might be hard for some of you to believe but seriously drive a Civic and then compare a Spectra  The one thing that impresses me the most about the Spectra over the Civic is its ease to drive  With the Honda I had to rev the heck out of the car to extract any type of decent speed  With the Kia and the close gear ratios of the 5 spd transaxle you can drive moderate and still achieve excellent acceleration  I just got tired of having to drive the Civic so hard around town  The way the Spectra handles is another strong point  With a Lotus tuned suspension and front AND rear anti sway bars  the Spectra remains composed and stable in corners  The only minus I can find is the tires which just don t have enough traction and side stability for me  In fairness though I had the same issue with the Honda and after replacing the Firestones with Yokohamas it totally changed the manners of that car  and I suspect the same with the Kia  The brakes work very well with no fade after several hard stops  My Spectra does not have anti lock brakes and so far I have not locked any of the wheels in hard braking Inside the Spectra is quite comfortable for this class of car  The seats are SO MUCH better than the Civic  I used to hate to take the Honda on long trips because of its hard flat seats and the material after 6 months started wearing out on the Civic  The seat material and cushioning is definately higher quality on the Kia  The dashboard on the Spectra is attractive and easy to see  All the controls are easy to get to  The only places that Kia skimped some seem to be the plastic door panels and the headliner and carpet seem on the cheap side but hey this IS a under  11 000 car One other thing to point out if you like doing your own engine service is that the 1 8L engine is quite easy to work on  I have changed the oil and filter and didn t even need a filter wrench to remove the old filter  Just reached down behind the engine and spun it off by hand  Everything else is pretty easy to get to as well Overall I must say that this is a great little car and as far as some of the other reviewers have said about Kia s reliability as they get older  take a look on the road and see how many Ford Festiva s and Ford Aspires  both made by Kia for Ford  and you may be surprised  Most of those cars are over 10 years old and still run great  I have known several people with them that say they are very happy  
Auto, Last year I decided to go back to school and finish my Ph D  Knowing that this would require at least three years of  quot living like a student quot  on a very fixed income  I knew it was time to trade in my last car for one that was more reliable  After a fair amount of reading in various publications  I narrowed the list of potential vehicles based upon price  maintenance records  driving costs  repair costs  etc  The final candidates were early to mid 90 s Maximas  several makes of Acura and Mazda  and the Mitsubishi Diamante  As far as established reputations  published or otherwise  all were very competitive  that is  until price comparisons were made  In a number of instances  I found Diamantes at half the price of competitors in similar condition  For me  the choice was obvious  I bought a 1992 Mitsubishi Diamante  V6 single cam in very clean condition with 112k miles for  5800  It now has 128k miles In the year that I ve owned the car  I have replaced an exhaust component  cost   100  replaced the timing belt  routine maintenance at 120k miles  cost   375  four oil changes and a tune up  I have also replaced a headlamp bulb  cost   3  the same tail light bulb twice  cost   2 each time  and both reverse lights have gone out  perhaps indicative of a small electrical problem Despite proper maintenance  the car is sluggish on hills  feeling as though the timing is always off a bit  hesitating until rpm s are above 3000  On the freeway  this usually means the car down shifts hard  from about 2700 rpm s to 4000 rpm s  a bit worrisome for a transmission with nearly 130k  The front brakes shimmy slightly Other than this  the car is a dream  Very comfortable  although a few more inches of head room would be nice  very quiet  and very stylish inside and out  The car is very stable on the road  having a heavy car feel  yet can be incredibly nimble with its sensitive steering and low stance  I love the instrument layout and the interior styling  Many friends have guessed the price at more than twice what I paid for it  If I could have given one piece of advice to Mitsubishi when building this car   quot Give it more low end power quot  The car easily exceeds 100mph on the freeway  but getting their can take a little run up  unless you don t mind redlining  The car has plenty of power  once I m above about 3100 rpm s  Below that is where the lack of low end torque is noticeable     
Auto, I purchased a brand new bright red truck in November 1995 my husband said   not another red truck  Yes  I like red  and I like trucks I had brought home a darker blue truck  but it was automatic  power windows  and other frilly stuff that I didn t want or want to pay extra for  My truck had the following features 6 cylinder  standard transmission  5 speed  anti lock brakes  back sliding window  long bed  A C  power steering  and a bed liner What I liked about this truck  at the time I bought it  was that we could all fit into it  However  for my older kids  the fold down jump seats in the back section were uncomfortable on long trips  The last big trip was from Tennessee to Oklahoma and then back  My son at the time was 15 and my daughter was 12  They were most uncomfortable and had to take turns riding up front  And I liked the price  It cost  12 799 with all the financial stuff  This was the third vehicle that I bought at  Woody Anderson Ford  in Huntsville  AL  And If I still lived there  I probably would have traded it there and bought another Ford product I was faithful about regular maintenance  but this silly truck had a mind of its own  First it was the door open chime it just would not shut off  Back to the dealership  it was covered under the warranty  Then the wipers went off on their own back to the dealership  covered by warranty  By this time I was wondering if I had made a good decision about this truck  Then the interior light would not shut off  my husband just got a potholder from the kitchen and yanked the bulb out  He was beginning to be frustrated by constant trips to the dealer for little electrical repairs I noticed a smell around 35 000 miles or so  Something was hot under my truck  I took it in and asked them if there was anything under there that might get hot during driving  They checked the radiator  and other items like brakes etc but not the problem  After the big trip to Oklahoma  it finally broke  and it was a carrier bearing  My mechanic basically told me that this was a design flaw since the drive shaft was not so long  it didn t really need to be built like this  Just another moving part to break Once all of the electrical problems were repaired and the carrier bearing was repaired  the truck was very reliable for 120 000 miles  And a trip to South Carolina  Myrtle Beach  At that time it was traded for a much more comfortable vehicle for our growing family of 5  We bought a  Plymouth Grand Voyager   van  See my review on it please My truck was not a reliable vehicle in ice it froze to the ground and we could not budge it no matter what we tried hahahhaha only in Tennessee right  Okay  so maybe it was built on a Monday  maybe it was just that model year  But I did not buy another Ford truck and I had owned 2  so maybe I ll let Fords rest and get a Toyota or a Chevy next truck purchase  
Auto, I recently purchased a decked out 2000 Buick Regal LS from my local Buick dealer  and i m happy to say I am not let down The car has a very smooth ride  which is only complimented by the very comfortable bucket leather seats  The car seems to literally glide on air and it also turns on a dime  I have no complaints whatsoever with the ride  The very powerful V6 provides ample power to go from point A to point B  and much  much  more  This is a very fast machine  folks  I was very surprised with how much kick this car has  considering it has a V6  The car of course  performs very well on wet roads and the brakes work excellent A surround sound Monsoon CD Cassette audio system also came with my car  This works very well  like the rest of the car  and provides enough bass and the very well placed speakers just add to its performance  Even the CD player has certain special touches  such as extra controls on the steering wheel  and even glow in the dark lights in the player so you can switch CD s at night  It s these extra little touches that make this car excellent  Opening up the moonroof while cruising down the highway is fun to do  also  There are only two complaints I have about this car  I got the car in black  and the paint is already starting to lose its gloss here and there  even though I purchased it recently  However  you can not notice it unless you were looking for it  and the black still shines radiantly in the sun  But as with any black car  you have to wash it often  as every little thing  such as dirt  or the occasional bird doo doo  shows up on the car  But that was to be expected  The car also came with the chrome hubcaps  which are stunning with the black paint  However  in the grooves of them  the chrome is starting to fade  However  this is only a minor problem  and the rest of it seems to be doing fine and shows no signs of fading Overall  this is a A  car  and a very enjoyable ride  The price is a little high for most people  Mine was  30 000  but it is a outstanding car and I heartily recommend it  
Camera, After looking through a plethora of digital cameras at my local CompUSA  I chose Casio s QV 8000SX  I selected this model for several major reasons  One the camera is reasonably priced  especially when compared to its ling list of features  And talking about features  the QV 8000SX has a laundry list full of them  It has a wonderful 8x zoom  color selection modes that even allow a sepia print setting  And probably the most important feature  very high picture quality  Another feature which I found particularly appealing is the screw mount on the lens  Going back to my 35mm roots  I like the idea of being able to add a filter to protect the lens proper The only feature missing from this excellent unit is an ac adapter  This has to be purchased separately  But apart from that  it s a great camera at a great price br br  
Auto, My wife and I were looking for a 7 or more passenger car or truck when we looked at the Ford Expedition  I am 6 2 and my wife is 5 1 so finding something that suits us both was not easy  This truck seats 8 and has the room we need for shopping  It was not a hard choice this was the vehicle we needed  I have had many bad salesmen shopping for cars but this time was different the ford salesman was very polite and did not do the high pressure sales pitch  he let us take our time and shop around  There is so much to love about this truck its hard to to pin down just a few but here goes  First to fully enjoy it you must get the Eddie Bauer package  its a few dollars more but well worth it  All leather seating the soft fluffy kind  The driver seat has heating for rear end  quot leather is cold in the winter quot  Speaking of winter the all wheel drive is great for this midwest weather  It has moving pedals with the touch of a button they raise or lower this is very useful for my wife as she would have had to sit closer to the steering wheel to reach the gas and brake with air bags and her size not good  I have recently had a chance to tow with it  I have a two place snowmobile trailer and you cant even tell that is back there by the way it handles  If I had to say theres one thing I dislike it would be the automatic head lights  I feel the need to shut them off my wife says its a control thing  By the way she just loves them br br  
Auto, Ok this review may not be all that great  but worthwhile decent  I bought this car around December of 1999 from an Arabian Individual  It was SALVAGED with 88 000 miles  At the time I didn t know what salvaged meant when I saw it on the DMV papers  then when the insurance explained the disadvantage of it  I was in serious anxiety  I bought this car for 5 800  where it was listed for 6500  but made a bargain  and where did I get that kind of money  From totalling my mother s 94 nissan sentra and I was at fault  Anyhow  how is this Mazda salvaged  The owner said it used to be stolen with the leather stripped and driver door broken and was hotwired  That s all the retailer said  I bought it anyway  Smart move huh  For some time problems occured  I had a rebuilt transmission which killed  2 500 out of me the most and has caused drama  I had rebuilt front left and right drive axles costing half a thousand dollars  rear sway bar left link replacement which less than a couple hundred  Two and a half years later I had an engine oil leak  cuz my dumb self was using valvoline high mileage oil and was kinda overfilling the oil  and that was 400 bucks  Sooner or later I had a COOLANT leak  It was probably a sign to change my timing belt and water pump  so therefore I had my timing belt and water pump service after noticing coolant leakage  Then ANOTHER problem days later after the service  except this will SHOCK YOU  my car just died out on the freeway at 65 75mph with the dash lights litted on and the HOLD light blinking  kinda difficult to start the car after pulling to the side off the pavement  but gave it a couple of minutes resting and got it running again  This happend to me three times  So took it in for service and they recommend new spark plugs  air filter  distributor and rotor cap  and they say I went 3000 miles over since my last oil change  and transmission fluid was red than usual so they drained and filled fluid at the time which was right every 30 000 miles and I believe its been 24 30 thousand miles after getting the rebuilt transmission  for a whopping  2400  So I brought it to be serviced AGAIN  Then I got the car back  AND IT DIED AGAIN ON THE FREEWAY    its such a DISGRACE for a new looking car to do that  So as of today  5 6 02  my car is in the shop AGAIN  but free diagnose of the engine problem but now they re making me pay a diagnose fee of the HOLD light coming on as a sign of a transmission problem and I have just had a rebuilt trans 2 years ago and its probably been just 24 30 thousand miles on it  Everything shifts fine and all I just don t wanna pay another    2500 AGAIN  AHHHHHH DAMN MAZDA TO HELL Is this car Japanese or American  When you start the ignition on a Honda  Acura  Nissan  Lexus  Toyota  Mitsu  and so on  except on a Mazda  dont their startup  rythm seem to sound alike  the rhythm is slow  on a Mazda it sounds like an American starter  where the rythm sounds fast  I noticed that the Ford Probe is exact to a Mazda 626 or MX6  Can anyone tell me if this car is actually a Ford  I saw a Ford commercial and like other brand logos appeared which means its made by Ford  even MAZDA  And is FORD reliable in some ways or not  Also  my friend also owned a V6 626 but 2 years newer  and her car had problems too  except not as much as I have  She has had timing belt and water pump service already  and now she has to worry about the axle boots and axles which went out after having the water pump and timing belt service  Fortunately  her car was in new condition with a CLEAN history title  but she dislikes it and she has already traded it in I don t understand why they permit salvaged cars to sell  don t they know that insurance won t cover a salvaged car fully  They should just keep the car at the junkyard for dismantling the parts to replace other parts and thats it nothing more nothing less I also have doubts that anyone will buy this car  I have close to 3 500 of repairs done from bringing the car into the dealership from day one  Would anyone buy it for 6 900 for the sake of goodwill and charity  I would encourage slow steady careful local drivers to think about it  I do need the money  It just sucks how this Scarlet Letter A salvaged title makes it cursed  If I ever get it sold for enough or if pick and pull buys it for a decent amount  I ll put that money as a down payment on a used but RELIABLE japan import car  and if I ever get a job  make monthly payments on a loan as well to the car I wished I have done this type of research with used car reliability guides and Epinions in the first place  but now its too late but now I know  DO NOT GET A MAZDA  EVEN IF YOU A RACER ENTHUSIAST GOING FOR THE RX 7  GET RID OF IT AND GET A TRUE JAPANESE CAR  LIKE ACURA OR HONDA  TOYOTA OR LEXUS  AND INFINITI OR NISSAN  MAZDA IS FORD  AND F O R D   Found On the Road Dead 
Camera, I received this camera as a gift  I already own a Polaraid PDC 700  a nice  but fairly featureless camera  What I LIKE about this camera are the features  zoom lens  dual compact flash cards  short video and time lapse photography  and the general feel  which is more like a camera than a lot of models  What I DISLIKE about the camera is  1  not having an AC adapter which is a  69 extra  say what   2  The unexplainable delay in the shutter when taking flash pictures  It s like  quot Click  nothing happens  I must not have turned it on  then FLASH quot  This makes the camera almost unsuitable for anything but still life inside  What I HATE about the camera is that I cannot get the software included for downloading the pictures to work  After several attempts I called the Panasonic help line and was flicked off after a brief attempt to help me   quot You should try it on another computer or call Microsoft quot  Now which of my dozen computers should I try next  I am able to download using the included Adobe software  but since it wants to save the pictures in a proprietary format  it s a long and tedious process to  quot export quot  each picture to a more standard JPEG format  I will be getting a flash card downloader which hopefully will solve the problem br br  
Camera, The new Hewlett Packard HP PhotoSmart C200cl Digital Camera is a great digital camera for beginners who want a reasonably priced camera and also want to be able to take great pictures with it  This was my first purchase of a digital camera and to tell the truth I knew nothing about what to look for in a digital camera  I went to several stores looking at different models and after reading the brochure on this camera I decided to give it a try  I am certainly glad I did  I am not extremely electronically inclined but the instructions were very simple to understand and in no time at all I was taking pictures like a pro  It has a 1megapixel  which at the time I knew nothing about but it just means that your picture turns out more real and a very solid plain photo  It also has a 2x digital zoom for close up shots and I like to take pictures of wild animals and this comes in really handy to get a close up without scaring them away  You can store up to 40 photos also and that is great  When you put your pictures into the computer then you can erase the ones you have on the camera or you can keep some and delete the others  I really like that feature as it makes it faster to download your pictures according to how many you have on the camera  If you are looking for a digital camera I would highly recommend this one  especially if you would like a great camera and an easy to use camera too br br  
Camera, With digital cameras prices falling so rapidly and often  it is a shame that every one does not have one yet  Kodak has one model  DC 280  that will meet the demands of nearly everyone and not draw a vacuum on your wallet  What would appear to be a fair quality 35 mm camera is actually a superb digital camera The DC280 by Kodak offers resolutions of 1 760 by 1 168 or 896 by 592 pixels  The images are extremely sharp and well focused  I was truly impressed with the quality of shots taken both inside and outdoors  While I prefer a higher storage capacity   I have seven kids  the 8MB  CompactFlash  memory card allows up to 97 standard or 12 higher resolution shots  Usually more than enough for my group shots  The simple design  compact chassis  and comfortable size belies it s durability  I even allowed the kids to take shots with it  The camera took the families antics on and continued to produce high quality shots even after a few drops and spills  The DC 280 is loaded with features many cameras do not offer  2X optical zoom provides excellent detail  The 1 8 inch LCD screen is bright and clear enough for shot selection in any light  And there are a large number of flash options which make for super special effects  Included with the DC280 are Adobe s PhotoDeluxe 3 1 and PageMill 3 0 software  Both provide easy picture editing and correction  which are rarely needed  Kodak also included their own special drivers to allow you to upgrade your system for proper operation with the DC 280  While I prefer the CD or disc storage of the SONY Mavicas  the Kodak DC 280 connects to your PC via USB  This is a much more rapid file transfer as compared to the old serial port of yesteryear  I wished that the battery life could be a bit more stout for the DC 280  I found myself forced to swap batteries after only 280 pictures  Fortunately I carry extras around because of digital cameras being so battery hungry  The best feature is the  Bang for your Buck  The DC 280 is now fetching a price of  or around  350 dollars  Figure in the cost of film and processing and you will pay for the camera in a year  And I do not think that you can get a better quality camera on the market for a price this low  not yet anyway  
Auto, I bought a 1998 Pontiac Sunfire and had nothing but trouble  Let me explain The engineering just didn t seem to be there  On the exterior  the hood looks to be open all of the time  the moonroof rattled  leaked  and jammed  the gascap door didn t line up with the rest of the quarter panel  and that Sunfire spoiler   haven t they cancelled that yet On the interior  things weren t much better  The drivers side sun visor cannot be put down all the way without nearly removing the rear view mirror  The drink holder cannot hold the ever so common 20 oz bottle  For that matter  the drink holder cannot hold ANY drink if the car  automatic  is in park I would recommend people steer clear of this car  It may be a bright color and look sleek  but it is a mound of trouble In this case  you will get what you pay for  
Camera, I am not new to digital cameras and  in a way I feel better equipped to explore the features of this camera now that I ve used another one extensively  Let me state right off the bat that if you aren t willing to give the manual a fair perusal  then this is probably not going to be a good camera for you My entry into the world of digital cameras came through an Agfa e780 camera  While this was an excellent introductory camera  it lacked zoom capabilities and the picture quality peaked out at 3 x 5 photos  I loved my little Agfa  don t get me wrong  It s just that I feel I have grown up now and I want a toy with more bells and whistles  The Olympus D 490 was the perfect  next step  for me One of the reasons I chose this camera over others was the price to features ratio  In my opinion  the Olympus D 490 offers features comparable to some of the higher end cameras without the higher end price tag Feature Highlights  not an all inclusive list b 1 8 inch color LCD monitor  The monitor on this camera is very sharp  The display is crystal clear and it is very easy to determine if you ve gotten the shot you wanted  While most digital cameras have an LCD screen these days  not all screens are created equal  The clarity on this one is one of the better ones I ve seen b 2 11 megapixel CCD for photo quality output  The higher megapixel allows for larger high resolution pictures  I have taken a couple of really nice landscape shots  printed them at 8 x 10 on my inkjet printer  framed them and hung them on the wall  I am exceptionally pleased with the quality  Even up close there is very little  almost none  graininess to be seen b 3X Optical Zoom with 2 5X Digital Zoom  This is one of the main features for which I bought the camera  The 3x optical zoom is perfect for scooting in on the squirrel in the yard or moving out to take in the  big  picture  I haven t used the digital zoom much as it requires switching from the optical viewer to the LCD  I just don t care to take pictures that way and I find that extra step not worth the effort  The picture quality degrades only slightly when using the digital zoom  so it is handy to have when you need it  but for the most part  the Optical Zoom is really quite adequate b Sequential shooting capability  This is a fun feature that allows you take a series of quick pictures without waiting for the camera to write them to the memory card  I haven t used this feature much  but it s pretty good for photographing and active child or pet  Out of the series  you are bound to get one good shot b Manual ISO settings  Being an extreme amateur  this is not a feature that I ve played with much  I do understand the different ISO settings  Auto  100  200  and 400  but I haven t found any reason to want to switch from Auto since the camera seems very adept at determining available light and adjusting appropriately   QuickTimeTM Movie mode  This is one of my favorite features  While stills are super  there is nothing more fun than being able to send a short film to grandma showing the kiddies blowing bubbles or falling in the snow  The manual says that the camera is capable of filming up to 15 seconds  on the included 8MB memory card  but I often find that a 6 or 7 second video is all I really want to capture a moment b Self timer with 12 second delay   This is another feature I don t use often  but I have used it and it is handy at times when I decide to come out from behind the shutter  I really prefer to be behind the scenes documenting everything  but once in awhile I set the camera on top of the TV and jump in the picture Another  pro  in my opinion  that seems to be  con  with others  is the fact that this camera uses the serial port for connection to the computer  I know USB is faster  A USB cable is available for this camera  but doesn t come with it  From now until 5 31 01  Olympus is offering a USB SmartMedia reader for free with proof of purchase  However  I have an older PC and it did not come with USB capabilities  I don t have a USB port  I know I could upgrade  and I probably will someday  but I don t care to be forced into it  This camera came with a serial port cable that plugs into the camera for picture transfer  It s slow  but it works and I m content with it The camera came with an 8MB SmartMedia card and long lasting Lithium batteries  The batteries are great  but I wish they were rechargeable  I have more in the wings  though  that are  The 8MB SmartMedia card is okay  but not great  I have two other 8MB cards  though so I can generally get all the pictures I want on a day s outing  I d need more  though  if I were going to be out where I couldn t download  Of course  there is always the option to use a lesser resolution  but that would defeat the purpose of having a megapixel camera in the first place Overall  my favorite part about this camera is the handling  An hour with the manual greatly improved my ability to manipulate the features and navigate through the menus  The menu options vary depending on whether the camera is off or on and I still get confused sometimes when looking for a specific option I would NOT recommend this camera to a digital beginner  I think it would be daunting and frustrating  My husband  a digital beginner  would concur  I love it  though  and it makes me feel like getting out and taking pictures  This camera is ready to use right out of the box but until you ve read the manual  you will miss a lot that this camera has to offer b HOW IT COMPARES  Back to my little Agfa 1 Being a 1 Megapixel camera  the Agfa had a higher yield on the 8MB card  This 2 Megapixel tiger eats up media space  Naturally 2 The flash was slow to warm up on the Agfa  This flash is ready to use the moment you open the flash housing  which has to be done manually 3 The Agfa had a fixed focus and fixed ISO setting  Great for general purpose use  but I do enjoy the flexibility of the Auto ISO and Zoom capabilities of the Olympus 4 Both cameras offered serial port connection with optional S Video port for TV display  No change there 5 The Agfa shut itself off eventually once it sensed it was being ignored  The Olympus has that capability but you don t realize it until you get into the software to set the camera settings  It even has variable settings  Good feature 6 The optical viewer on the Agfa was centered on the body  This caused you to place your nose print prominently on the LCD screen  Ugly smear  The Olympus is offset to the left and is much cleaner to use 7 The Olympus also offers and adjustment on the Optical Viewer to better align the view with the lens  in case you keep cutting Uncle Harold s head off Overall  I am proud to have traded up to my Olympus  I am thoroughly pleased with camera as a whole and my only objection was the size of SmartMedia card they chose to send with it  Compared to the 2MB card that came with the Agfa  though  I suppose I m not too disappointed A final note others have complained about the way the camera closes and turns off  In order to close the camera  you have to slide the lens door toward the lens almost but not quite touching  The lens will then retract and you can finish closing the door  It is a little awkward at first  but it is really not as bad as all that  However  my husband  who works second shift  did wake me up in the middle of the night the first night we had the camera  He had opened it but couldn t figure out how to close it I feel like I am probably forgetting something major  This camera is so feature packed and versatile that it is impossible to cover everything here  that s why they enclose a 140 page manual  While it might not be the  choice of the pros  and it might be a bit challenging to the beginner  is it certainly ample camera for this intermediate level user  I love it and I m proud to have it For examples of some of the pics taken with this camera  go to http community webshots com

Camera, My friend bought this camera and let me borrow it on my trip to vegas  I have to say this was not as bas as i thought  Although it had a flash it was not very good taking pictures at night  I recommend when you take shots  take in a very well lit area or daytime  Another thing is this camera has no zoom  so it was hard to take pictures on one person  you would get soooo many people in the picture  And this camera is 1 3 megapix  This is good quality  but i recommend 2 2 or higher  it makes a big difference in quality  The price is probably the best thing  It was goin for 299 99 at bestbuy  This is one the cheaper cameras with a lcd screen on it  If are willing to spend more money then get the nikon or sony digital camera  Another good thing is the media  There are no pics to develop and it was sooo easy to download them to my computer and email it to all my friends  This is the cost advantage then to other regualar cameras  but all in all i would wait till prices go down br br  
Camera, OK  you should really read this epinion if you are considering entering the digital camera sphere  I bought my Polaroid PDC 700 through Amazon for  219  It came with carrying case and strap  4 Duracell Ultra batteries  serial cable  video cable  camera to TV  and AC adapter  The software disks are PhotoMAX Imagemaker and PhotoMAX Pro  The kit also included a VERY limited manual  I would strongly recommend that you go to the Polaroid web site and download the entire 58 page manual  It fills in all the gaps in the learning curve and does it well This was my first digital camera purchase  I am an experienced photographer working in conventional film media and favor Minolta and Canon  but after a great deal of research  the PDC was the clear choice for entry level digital  It has a 1024 X 768 matrix and the image quality is very good  particularly when viewed on a 25 quot  television screen  The lens optics are excellent by any standards  and the shutter is surprisingly fast  Aperture is f 3 5 and speed roughly equivalent to to ISO 150  In it s highest resolution mode  XGA at 1 8 compression  its storage is limited to 12 images  but I find 1 15 perfectly satisfactory for home use  That will give you 25 photographs using the internal 4MB memory  You can always transfer images to a memory card and keep right on going Ease of use is excellent  Trust me  I do not grasp new concepts like a 20 YO  and this little camera is a breeze  Don t believe all the warnings about rapid battery depletion  yes  they go fast  but I have over 100 images on the original batteries  Just use the AC adapter whenever possible  especially for downloads and times went the LCD is on in live action  like setting up macro photographs  Some reviews also criticize download speed  OK  it is a little slow on the serial cable  but might be faster using USB The software is easy to load and works well  Image manipulation is simple and fun you will have a blast creating screen savers and greeting cards right in your own back yard  but it could be more versatile for really fancy adjustments of lighting and contrast  Polaroid has outstanding customer support and the help line is readily available if you need  Summary  buy this little camera  No I am not and never have been an employee or shareholder of Polaroid  I just like this thing  It is perfect for on line auctions  it does exactly what it says it will do  does it better than others in the same price range  and will serve you very well as the technology evolves br br  
Camera, This is my 5 year old s third digital camera  The first two  JamCam Jr  JamCam 2  were just too darned cheesy and hard to use   Who would have thought it  a kidcam being hard to use  After those experiences with kidcams  I wanted to get him a low end real camera  not a toy  He s been using my Canon Powershot S10 since he was 2  and loves it  A new camera for him didn t have to be quite that good  but it needed to have an LCD display  it needed to have a flash  it needed to take decent pictures  it needed to use replaceable media  and it needed to be relatively cheap This camera fills that bill nicely When I first got it I tried to feed it alkalines  Bad move  Brand new alkalines show dead almost instantly  I read up on battery characteristics and bought some NiMHs  and their life has been perfectly acceptable  I haven t tested how long they live   obviously that ll depend on how much you use the LCD and how much you use the flash   but it hasn t been a problem so far If you have Windows XP  ME  maybe  not sure  then the software is the best  none  Plug it in and Windows recognizes it as a disk drive  sees all those  JPG files  and offers to do picture type stuff with them  Cool  No third party drivers I believe it loses its clock setting when you replace the batteries  Boo hiss  It resets the picture number when you empty it  so you can t get unique file names for all your pictures from the camera It d be nice if it d display the estimated remaining number of pictures on a separate low power LCD like the S10 does  but since media prices have gotten so low I just bought a 64M card and it s usually not an issue One of the most telling endorsements is that when I want to take a quick picture of something around the house  if I see this camera before I see the Canon  I ll use it  
Auto, Before I get into my review of my 1994 Chevrolet Astro  I feel the need to say that I LOVE THIS VAN  In all seriousness  it has probably been the smartest purchase of my life  It has faithfully served myself and my four boys for seven years and over 160 000 miles  and continues to give me everything I ask for in a car with the same quality it did when it rolled off the dealer s lot I purchased the van in late 1994  as a dealer closeout at a rock bottom price  For the premium LT  luxury touring  model on the extended body and all wheel drive  it was mine for about  24 000  A little bit expensive  but when I looked down the street at the Dodge Grand Caravan  a more car like and more stylish model  I found that for a premium trim  comparable equipment  with all wheel drive  the sticker ran well over  30 000  It seemed like a no brainer to me what the smarter deal was  I gave up the more car like temperament of the Grand Caravan but kept  6000  in my pocket  Although it s not as stylish looking as the Chrysler built minivans  its strengths lie in other areas  One of these such areas is the powertrain  4 3 liters of high output V 6 engine serve up 200 horsepower and over 250 pound feet of torque  This translates into smooth around town acceleration as well as easy highway merging and two lane passing  The four speed automatic transmission with overdrive is a perfect match for the engine  with it s crisp shifts and an overdrive gear for quiet highway cruising  The fabulous all wheel drive system has never left me stranded in snow  sleet and ice and provides a notable advantage in handling and balance on dry roads The Astro is a body on frame van  which means that its bodywork is bolted to a full steel ladder frame  This is good for towing   don t ask me why  but I do know that the Astro is rated to pull over 5000 lbs  Compare that to a maximum of 3 800 lbs  for Chrysler minivans  The exceptionally spacious interior is also well suited to highway cruising  with it s comfortable seats   especially with LT trim  Standard seating is two front captain s chairs  power on the driver s side  with adjustable lumbar supports and headrests  my particular van came with second  and third row split folding bench seats that have folding center armrests and outboard headrests  Although they are a little on the heavier side  these bench seats are easily removable to open up 170 cubic feet of cargo space The one thing I cannot emphasize enough is the durability of this minivan  160 000 miles later  and with only normal periodic maintenance  it still functions as it did the day I bought it  The body is in perfect condition  I only wash it about twice a month and wax it about twice a year  and the paint still has a glossy shine to it  The interior has taken the abuse my four boys and I have dished out to it in stride   the scotchgard treated cloth seats and carpet resist stains surprisingly well  and the seat cloth shows no wear spots  The suspension has never needed any repairs save for one set of leaf springs  considering the amount of loading and towing I do  this is nothing short of a miracle  and still provides a comfortable ride  The engine starts up with absolutely no hesitation  even on a below zero morning  runs smoothly  quietly and without complaint  and most importantly  has never failed me   something I cannot say about my 1995 Voyager   read my review and you ll know what I m talking about However  even I have to admit that this van has it s pitfalls  Nothing in life comes without a price  and the price that comes with this van is the lousy gas mileage  I have consistently averaged between 16 and 17 mpg with this vehicle  This is no doubt attributable to the large displacement  for a V 6  truck engine and the all wheel drive system  The control panel also leaves a lot to be desired  The first generation instrument panel of the Astro placed climate controls to the immediate right of the gauge cluster  which curiously includes a voltmeter and oil pressure gauge but not a tachometer  and the sound system in the dead center of the dashboard  This is inconvenient for two reasons   1  The front passenger cannot comfortably reach the climate controls  and 2  The driver cannot comfortably reach the sound system  In 1996  Chevrolet updated the Astro  to include a new dashboard layout which features easy to use rotary climate control knobs and new Delco sound systems  The final downfall of this vehicle is the substandard crash test scores  NHTSA rated the 1994 Astro as three stars  average  for the driver and one star  very poor  for the front passenger in their front impact test  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also dealt the Astro a sickening blow with its 1996 40 mph offset crash test  which produced extremely poor results  To see the results of this test  visit the following URL  http www hwysafety org vehicle ratings ce html 96024 htm  Although this test was conducted on a dual airbag equipped Astro  the offset crash test is more demanding on the structure of the car rather than the restraint systems  so the results of the 1996 test are largely applicable to earlier models  The lack of a front passenger airbag  a standard feature on Grand Caravan and Town   Country  certainly did not help this along at all  A passenger airbag was added in 1996 along with the aforementioned redesigned dashboard  As I have never been in an accident with this van  knocking on wood here  however  I cannot attest to the real world crashworthiness of this vehicle  Prospective buyers should note  however  that Grand Caravan received four stars  enough to earn a  good  rating  for both the driver and front passenger in 1994 Regardless of the vehicle s flaws  it has done a commendable job of transporting my family and I see no signs of it ceasing to operate anytime in the near future  When it does  however  I ll be back at my Chevy dealer  looking for a new Astro  I recently drove my friend s  02 Astro LT  and I noticed all the positive attributes of my workhorse as well as some new features I would enjoy  As a final word  I think it goes without saying that this van has certainly lived up to my expectations  and I would certainly recommend it to anyone searching for a functional  spacious  capable minivan  UPDATE  1 6 2004   Dad  come out and look That was one of my 16 year old twins  pulling into the driveway after work the other day  I went to the front door and he was standing by the Astro  with its driver s door open  Puzzled  I went over to where he was standing and looked into the vehicle  I didn t notice anything out of the ordinary  I gave him a strange look  and he pointed to the instrument cluster  This time  I took notice  The mechanical odometer indicated that the van had been driven exactly 250 000 miles  Wow  It is a small feat that the van has even made it this far  but it is nothing short of a miracle that it has done so with little more than routine maintenance  I still change the oil every 3 000 miles  which happens about once a month  with MaxLife synthetic oil  the transmission gets flushed every 25 000  which is about twice a year I would prefer every 12 000  but at  99 a pop  my wallet prefers otherwise  and I add a can of Restore at every other oil change  I started using Restore at about 185 000 miles  and the car literally feels like new again  My nephew  who is my mechanic of choice  dropped the car off at my house after installing new brakes  practically gushing at how well the van runs  Even though the van now serves mostly around town duty  like grocery store runs and my kids driving back and forth to school  I have no doubt that I could hop in and drive across the state  or even across the country  with no problems  This van has certainly earned its place in my garage  Long Live The Astro  
Camera, I love this camera  I have had it for about 8 months and I find that it takes GREAT pictures PROS  The unit is small enough to fit in your jacket pocket  software is easy to use  the little LCD screen makes camera an ease to set up  you can see your picture on the screen before uploading CONS  The upload cable and the A C adapter cable plug in very close to each other TIPS  Buy the A C adapter at the same time you buy the camera  I searched for 3 weeks to find the adapter by itself  Watch for this item on Ebay or Ubid  I got mine for under  200 00 in the factory box with warranty I use this camera for all my Ebay items and for taking finer pictures of items for my sales job  day job Ted Patton Pipersville  PA   
Auto, The Intrepid is our 5th Chrysler product and we love it  It is a family car due to it s roomyness but yet a sporty car due to it s looks and powerful 6 cylinder engine  We needed a bigger car and the Intrepid sold itself in it   The trunk is enormous  the seats feel like recliners and there is enough footroom for everyone as well  We got a great deal on an Es 1998 model cause we bought it in january of 1999 and they had to get it sold I love the Es version mostly because of the leather interior   My two year old will spill juice on the seat and all i have to do is get a babywipe and clean it up  No problem at all  I also love the Autostick feature  It s an Automatic for drives around town and highways   but then you can shift it in the Stickmode if you re going up a hill and need some more power or if you want to manouver the car through traffic it surely comes in handy  It s definetly a luxery car and i have had alot of people approach me and ask about it   all i tell them is that i would highly recommend it We only had one problem with it so far and that was something with the Autostick  It only drove in 2nd gear most of the time and the stick mode didn t work at all but Chrysler was very fast and friendly and got it fixed in a couple of hours br br  
Camera, If you are about to upgrade yourself to a new digital camera  or you want to be inside this little world of digi pics  this is a good tool to start with some Pro features in a cheap pack  USB standar cable connection to your PC and a great resolution of 3 3 megapixels  real  non interpolated wich is much to say Even knowing that there are no pro lens inside this camera  the resollution is great compared to a 35mm optical camera  with it s 1 1 8 CCD you can really capture some details with it s macro mode from 30 to 40 cms and then creating a really cool effect of deep of field with it  adjusting the sharpness with 3 levels of sharp and several light conditions variables is a great chance to take eye candy pics the pics are 3 4 proportions  wich fits perfectly on your monitor and you can crop the pictures later on the included software to make really impressive prints The camera material is a little too soft  so you better get a case for it if you want it to last for a good while  and remember to have at hand a couple of extra batteries at hand  and if they are rechargeable  better when you are using the cam at it s best resollution you can only count on 8 to 9 pics with the internal memory  so if you plan to go outside to take really lots of 3 3 res  pics  you will need a 128 Complactflash memory to take up to 70  pics I m still amazed about the color quality of this camera  I don t know how they got to have this kind of quality with this cheap pack  but is amazing how you can capture so many datails and colors The technical facts are lots and they are really cool  in price terms  when comparing to a Canon or Sony cam  i e    and you won t be regret of buying this camera  the color LCD is really handy  but it eats a lot of power  but you can turn it off anytime  so  no problem  The lack of an optical zoom is one of it s cons  but shurely you wont need it that much with the macro mode End word BUY IT it worth it  
Camera, I bought this camera in June of 2000 and have used it constantly since then without any problems  I traveled a lot this summer and the small size was convenient  I took photography fall term this year and used this camera and got photo quality results for 8x10 prints with the resolution of the camera  People would pass by and see my picture next to one someone had done in the darkroom and not even realize the difference  I have fooled around with or used most of the features which I ll now go through When the camera is turned on the lens cover opens and the lens comes out  The circular display reads hello  It will then show the battery life and show the mode  amount of pictures left  flash settings  and zoom  The mode can be changed by rotating a circular knob on top  The modes are setup  video  continuous shooting  manual  auto  portrait  landscape  and night photography  Auto mode is great for beginners  All they would have to do is zoom in or out and decide whether a flash was necessary the camera has a pop up flash  They can take it with or without the LCD screen  In manual mode the white balance  exposure  flash  and sensitivity can be adjusted  Portrait  landscape  and night photography modes are self explanatory  Most of the time I usually leave it on manual for portraits or landscapes and it has worked fine but I always kick myself for not have changing the mode  I ve used night photo mode for my night photo assignment and it worked well  Since the shutter is open for longer you ll need to use a tripod to make the image sharp  For some of my pictures I purposely moved the camera to create streaks of light and it worked just like a manual camera would have  Another plus is the macro lens which also came in handy for one of my assignments  The assignment was nature abstracted and we had to shoot from odd perspectives  With the macro lens I was able to really zoom in on things and see textures  I was really surprised by the video  I ve only used it for videos ranging from 2 15 seconds but they have been pretty sharp and have had surprisingly good sound  Playback  Playing back pictures is done by flicking a switch  You can go through pictures  play videos  view a slideshow  delete pictures  protect files  and resize image resolution  It s all pretty easy and the slide show has a variety of transitions which I thought was cool  The only con of this camera is using the LCD screen drains the battery much quicker which is pretty much inevitable no matter what camera you buy  The solution  Carry extra batteries  It comes with 2 NiMH batteries but I recommend buying extra sets  I have a rotation of 3 sets of batteries which works well for my usage  In a bind you can use 2 AA batteries but they won t last very long  Another thing is that to my knowledge  Fuji doesn t make a carrying case for this camera  I just went to my local photo store and found a case that was a perfect fit made by the brand Tamrac  Until I found that  I just used a soft cotton drawstring sack from an airline that once held toothpaste etc  I d recommend having a case or some kind of protection  I ve also heard some people complain that the buttons were too small but I personally thought they were fine In conclusion I think this camera was one of the best investments I ve made and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera that s compact and or high res under  1000  I hope I covered everything and please feel free to email me about any further questions   ashie3 inorbit com   
Camera, I recently received the Kodak DC215 as an early Christmas gift  so I can t complain as a buyer  as I didn t actually pay for it    I know that in Atlanta  the going retail rate in the stores is still hovering around  299 for this camera  but the person who purchased it for me found it at of all places  Wal Mart  at  249  After having used this camera a bit longer  I ve edited my opinion  as seen below  for the good  bad  and misc Edited Epinion   12 10 00  it s longer  take a deep breath b THE GOOD b The Kodak DC 215 is in fact  has a very solid feel to it  due to it s metal body  a nice change compared to today s mostly plastic bodies on other digital cameras costing even more  It has a nice feel to it  and a simple   quot square ish quot  body  with a rubber grip on the end for holding comfort  The LCD display is on top of the camera and is easily readable  with four buttons to the right   the larger being the shutter  photo  button  and three smaller buttons to control flash settings  macro  close up  mode  and a self timer  On the back are the color Viewer  power  zoom control  settings control  and selection buttons  All are very intuitive  and easy to figure out  even without the manual  The color viewer is slightly recessed  unlike many cameras where it sticks out from the camera body  making it harder to scratch  There is also an optical viewfinder you may use  to conserve batter life  color viewers take A LOT of battery power from your camera  which is located up and to the left of the color viewer  Nice   you won t leave nose prints on the color view screen  lt G gt A quick note   the documentation for the DC 215 is also excellent  especially for beginners  A clearly and easy to read manual is included  and even my roommate  a techno phobe  could understand it It s nice to find an  optical  zoom on a camera of this price range  instead of a less detailed  digital  zoom  Still  if you re new to digital cameras  you should note that a 2X optical zoom is only equal to a slightly closer than  quot real vision view quot  In other words  2X is not technically a  quot zoom quot    3X and above are truly  quot zooms quot  that get you noticeably closer to the object s  to be photographed than your normal vision would see  Still  again  a 2X optical is nice for this price range Photo quality is a mixed bag  depending on the environment  I ve found that indoor photos with the flash and without  during day hours with natural sunlight in the rooms  turn out pretty nice overall  The flash does tend to flatten out colors slightly  but not enough to make the photos turn out horrible  For the most part  colors are rich and detail is pretty good  The various quality settings  talked about below more  allow you to adjust the camera for better quality indoor photos as well  with a greater range of quality settings than found on some other cameras b THE BAD b Outdoor photos are somewhat more of a disappointment with the DC 215  Outside  photos are fine when your subject is within 12 15 feet of you  However  the DC 215 s fixed focus lens is not able to capture great details on distant objects  such as landscapes  mountains  trees  etc  Only an auto focus lens found on other camera  usually costing more  will provide that detail  In other words  the DC 215 is great for casual photos of the pets  kids  or get togethers  but I might not pick it for those cherished scenic shops of your vacation in Europe  If you re lucky enough to get  quot Paint Shop Pro 7 quot  then you ll find that you can increase the image quality of many of your photos  however My largest disappointment with the DC 215 is the very flimsy door that you flip open in order to retrieve the Compact Flash storage card  I feel this is going to be the first part of the camera to break for many folks  especially if you re a guy with big fingers    The small button you must swivel up and push in  in order to eject the Flash card  is equally frail  I ll take points off for these two features   Kodak should have done a better quality job on these parts b MISC b The standard silver DC 215 edition camera comes with a 4 meg Compact Flash card  This may or may not allow you to store a lot of photos  depending on your settings  so  you may wish to invest in another larger storage card  For example  if you wish to print your photos  then you ll want to set your camera for  quot best quot  resolution  1154 x 864 pixel size  and  quot best quot  quality  which will then only allow you to save about 13 photos  If however  you re only going to email your photos  you may be able to set the camera for  quot standard quot  resolution  640 x 480 pixel size  and  quot good quot  quality  which then allows you to save up to around 59 photos  The higher the quality setting  the less  quot jaggies quot  and blurred  quot artifact quot  object you ll see in your photos  but the less photos you can store on the card  I settled for a standard physical size of 640x480  and  best  quality  which is the clearest quality setting  so I get approximately 28 photos per 4 meg card  Sounds confusing  but you ll get the hang of it soon enough   the manual is very clearly written to help you understand If you re a heavy photo taker  invest as many will say here  in rechargeable batteries  I recently purchased a set of 4 nickel metal hydride  Maxell  brand batteries at Circuit City with the charger  for under  30  and they work well with this camera  and add to the amount of time you can use it   RATING AND SAMPLE PHOTOS  I ll give this camera a good rating for the casual photo taker  Ebayers  real estate and insurance folks  and those who like to make small casual print  as well as those who like to email pics of the kids and pets to the grand folks  As I said before  if you re wanting a camera to take 5 star quality scenic or vacation photos   I d look for one of the Olympus brands  like the 460  490  or 3030 model numbers  for that kind of quality  The DC 215 is worth the investment for it s ease of use  and adequate photo quality for the price If you d like to see some sample pics I ve taken with the DC 215  as well as an Olympus and a couple of older cameras  please feel free to visit my Yahoo photo page at  http photos yahoo com greg30127 Happy photo taking br br  
Camera, I just bought this camera a week ago  and the early returns on it are good  Kodak had a nice quick start guide poster that gets you going immediately  Took me about 20 minutes to take some pictures and transfer them to my pc  That s including going through some of the basic menu function settings  like deleting shots  using the 2x zoom The colors are truly something  Vibrant and clear This is a great starter camera  My main use is for e mails and storing photos on my hard drive  I thought of going the more expensive route  but after reading favorable reviews for this camera I was sold  I paid  170  plus there s a  30 rebate  Under  150 is a steal  Why pay over  300 for 2 3 megapixel cameras now  If and when I decide to upgrade in a year or so the prices of the higher pixel cameras will probably be under  300 Yes  the 2 mb of internal memory is low  and there is no USB support  That can be remedied w  the picture card reader  30  and flash card memory   40 50 for 32 mb  No lens cap included but one can be obtained free from Kodak upon request  which I did when I registered the camera at their website  If you re looking for a camera for e mail and personal use this is more than adequate  Besides  for e mail it s really better to send photos with a lower pixel count  2 megapixels or more is overkill Another small feature I like is that it uses AA batteries  which in the long run can be much cheaper than specific camera batteries  You can use regular alkaline or the new nickel metal halide rechargeables  
Auto, Americans travelling in Europe for the first time often have a moment of culture shock when they hail a taxi and a Mercedes E class or BMW 5 series pulls up to the curb  In America  these cars have been icons of intelligence and success for more than a generation  In their homeland they are more likely to be diesel powered taxis designed for durability and low operating cost than ultimate driving machines bred for the autobahn In the late 80 s Ford tried to beat the Germans at their own game  In 1986 they had bet the company on the groundbreaking Taurus  If you weren t there  it is almost impossible to imagine the impact this car had on the American auto industry  Its styling was as cutting edge as any European sedan of the time and it had much more of a European feel than any American sedan made before  It couldn t compete against the European sedans sold here  But Ford wondered if the Germans could remake a taxi into a world class sport sedan  could they do it with a car that had won the hearts of conservative middle America That was the challenge that faced the Taurus SHO throughout its eleven year production run  It was by any objective standard a worthy competitor to the midsize entries from BMW and Mercedes  one with a distinctive American accent  But in the end not enough buyers could make the mental leap that this Taurus was different than the one their parents had traded in their Fairmont or Caprice Classic for b Overview and Driving Impressions b There were three generations of the SHO  The first  1989 1991  was the original  86  quot Jellybean quot  Taurus platform with the SHO V 6 and suspension component upgrades  The final version  1996 1999  used the all new  quot Oval quot  Taurus platform and carried an equally new V 8  But I don t recommend either  The first generation SHO was a great engine mated to a chassis that wasn t intended for it  while the third became so refined it lost much of the distinctive personality in the earlier versions  The sweet spot was the 1992 1995 second generation cars  In 1992 all Taurii were redesigned and the SHO received distinctive front and rear styling that gave it a crisper  stronger look than the first edition  Under the skin several weaknesses and customer complaints had been addressed  and the entire platform was strengthened  giving the SHO handling abilities that came closer to matching the Germans than any American sedan that came before  And in 1993 it finally got the automatic transmission the pundits said it needed to win over American buyers The heart of the SHO was its engine  Yamaha was originally hired to design a new cylinder head for the 3 0 liter Ford V 6  The head they came up with produced too much power for the Ford block to live with  so Ford contracted them to come up with an entire powerplant  Their answer was a dual overhead cam  24 valve V 6 that only shared a three liter displacement with the engine in lesser Taurus models  The engine was a marvel  With 220 horsepower available the SHO was the most powerful engine in its class by a slim marging  But it weighed 400 pounds less than the Merc and 500 pounds less than the BMW  This made the Taurus SHO the quickest car in its class More important than the numbers was how different the three cars felt in action  The Mercedes  from its engine to how the ashtray door closed with a solid but velvet smooth action  felt literally like a bank vault on wheels  The BMW reeked of refinement by drivers  extremely capable yet never feeling like it would lose its composure  Both were outstanding cars with clear personalities  But neither  in my book  compared to the shot of tequila and a big slap on the back feeling of the SHO  When you got into the gas in the Ford the engine growled  the steering wheel tugged slightly in your hands  then the growl became a roar as the tachometer needle swung quickly towards 7 000 rpm  It wasn t crude  in capable hands the SHO was a remarkably composed car to drive at speed with little body roll and crisp responses  The SHO was simply spicier and more engaging than the Germans One of the big reasons to choose a second generation car over a first is the shifter mechanism for the five speed transaxle  First gen SHO s used a cable actuated shifter that had all the feel of stirring a pot of warm molasses  Starting in  92 all five speed SHO s ditched the spaghetti wires for solid linkage that greatly improved the feel  But it was still notably less precise than the action on the rear wheel drive BMW with its superb five speed  All front wheel drive cars share this handicap compared to a good rear wheel drive setup  Torque steer  another bane of powerful front wheel drive cars  could tug the wheel in your hands but you really had to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your driving  As I mentioned earlier  in 1993 the SHO got the slushbox  automatic  the critics said the market wanted  The thinking was  as only a relative few BMW s came to America with manual gearboxes and Mercedes didn t offer them on any model in the E class  to compete the SHO needed an automatic even if the purists had a fit over it  The critics were half right  The automatic didn t make the SHO a bestseller but it did improve the feel of driving the car  This is just my personal preference  but in a midsized or larger sedan I prefer an automatic if it is done right  Hustling a small light sports car up a road and snapping through shifts is one of life s greater joys  but a 3 000 pound sedan is more enjoyable when the strategy is smoothness and forethought  And a good automatic is better partnered to this style of driving  In the SHO it was no contest in my book  The automatic was a better automatic than the manual was manual  Huh  While the manual was improved in  92  it still had an imprecision that hindered finding a gear instinctively  The automatic was better mated to the SHO  with crisp  smooth upshifts that matched the sporting personality of the car  and the effect of torque steer was greatly reduced compared to the manual  Unless you are the kind of enthusiast who can t have any sports car with an automatic  the auto is a better way to go If the Taurus was a bargain BMW  as reviewers and fans called it  it hid the trimmed corners well  I don t know how Ford made a dime on them  I prepped new cars and did trim NVH repairs at a large Ford dealer in 92 94 and quickly noticed that a loaded out Taurus LX was only a couple of thousand dollars less than a SHO  Fully equipped  with leather  excellent power sport seats  full power accessories  power glass moonroof  premium  JBL  sound  CD and the automatic the sticker came in at less than  25 000  The E 320 and 530i weighed in at almost twice that fifty large in the same trim  It s the greatest price disparity between similar cars that I ve ever seen b Reliability And Maintenance b Against all bets when it was in production  the second generation SHO has proven itself a remarkably durable car  Only three big dollar problem areas have been uncovered on the second generation cars  SHO s driven in the snowbelt during winter have been known to develop corrosion in the engine subframe  It s not a fatal problem  the subframe can be replaced for a few hundred dollars  including labor  The front brakes are another consistent source of trouble  The second generation cars were slightly better but Ford simply put rotors on the car that were too small to stand up to the punishment of a high performance sports sedan  The rotors get too hot and warp when used hard  and like most cars made in the last decade Ford only included enough metal on the them to have them machined and trued once   Maybe  if you were lucky and caught it soon enough  Finally  for all the initial concern about funneling 200 lb ft of torque through a front wheel drive transaxle  the only weak link has been the clutch in the manual transmission models  The brake and clutch problems can be cured with the right application of high performance parts  and the engine subframe is a job that should be good for several years  All in all  not a bad list of  quot major quot  problem areas for a high performance car   And by contrast  the second generation base Taurus models have earned a lemon reputation for blowing head gaskets in their 3 8 liter engines and eating their AXOD E transaxles The SHO models shared no engine parts with the base models and used specially modified transmissions that have proven very durable  Can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that is more reliable than the base model One problem area that isn t unique to the SHO but needs to be mentioned is the importance of keeping the thermostat and catalytic converters in good condition  If the thermostat sticks open the engine won t overheat  but something just as bad can happen  All fuel injected engines use the engine temperature as one of the major factors to determine the air fuel mixture  If the engine is running too cold  as it will when the thermostat is stuck open  the mixture will be too rich  But instead of this unburned fuel vapor pouring out the tailpipe and creating smog  it is ignited and burned in the cat  Which gets much hotter than it was designed to be and begins to break apart inside  It s not a problem until you lift off the gas from a higher engine speed  like when getting off the freeway  When you do this the airflow through the engine reverses momentarily and because the cats on the SHO are mounted close to the engine if there is any debris in the cat it can be sucked back into the engine  It is just a destructive as pouring metal shavings in the intake  All four areas should be checked out before buying a SHO  The Yamaha engine has proven to be as tough as granite  Aside from possible valve guide wear in hard driven cars there haven t been any major problems with the engine at all   Look for a little blue smoke at a cold startup  hard starting  or oil consumption greater than a quart every 700 miles  Like most of their motorcycle engines  the SHO does not have hydraulic valve adjustors so the clearance has to be set by a mechanic  But unlike a bike it s not a regular occurrence  Ford specifies a major service between 60 000 and 100 000 miles that includes a valve adjustment and replacing the engine timing belt  spark plug wires and control arm bushings  It is a major bill  but nothing compared to the expense of failure if something like the timing belt lets go  and this service on the SHO will cost a fraction of the same service expenses on a BMW or Mercedes as the miles reach this territory   One note  The SHO  like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine  should have the coolant system flushed and replaced every year Other problems fall into the nitpick category  In looking through the newsgroup boards  I was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the problems owners are reporting after five years are the same ones I saw when the cars were still under warranty  most involving interior trim parts  Is my relief confusing  While the lumbar support leaking and the wiper control on the turn signal stalk failing too soon is evidence that there were some areas where Ford missed the mark in design and manufacture  after five to seven years I expected to see new problems emerging as the cars piled up the miles and that hasn t been the case  The good news is  the owner groups have developed inexpensive solutions for all the interior problems if you have a little mechanical ability with one exception  If you notice the driver seat rocks when you sit down or move the only fix is replacing the power mechanism  a bracket with the adjustor motors and trays that move the seat  It s not a safety hazard the seat is still firmly attached to the floor  But if you want to repair it plan on laying out about  300 for a new power mechanism   Pricing and Owner Support b The discovery of the enthusiast and aftermarket support on the web for the SHO has been another pleasant surprise  There are regional SHO owner clubs across America and a strong aftermarket for replacement and high performance parts   Note to gearheads  The level of aftermarket support for the V 6 SHO is as good as you ll find for a Camaro or Mustang  At extremely affordable prices for this class  too  Along with continued parts support from Ford  the SHO is one of the rare limited edition models that hasn t become an orphan in retirement  But it does remain one of the best values in the entire automotive market  The Kelly Blue Book quotes a  10 200 retail price for a  95 SHO automatic with 75 000 miles in my area  Like when it was new that is almost exactly half the Blue Book for a 530i or E 320  But in my area that would buy you an immaculate car  In the last year I ve seen close to a dozen very clean 92 95 SHO s with prices in the  7 000 range  And because most SHO buyers weren t testosterone poisoned young adults  read Camaro Mustang market  the chances of finding a well maintained and cared for car are very good b Conclusion b A SHO has been on my list of cars to have since I worked on them at Earnhardt Ford  It s a terrific sports sedan at an econobox price that has held up remarkably well  and the Mad Scientist in me still gets an evil grin when I think about the things I wanted to do with it   And that was when I only imagine stripping all the power amenities and losing a quick 60 70 pounds just on the interior  Now I can get superchargers that make up to  400 horsepower i  Bottom line  As an entertaining and unique sport sedan to be appreciated for what Ford created  or as the platform for a midlife crisis  the SHO is impossible to beat  It was one of the most easily overlooked cars when it was new  and today it has become a hidden treasure for enthusiasts  And if a Bimmer owner scoffs  as they are wont to do  just ask how he likes his taxi    Brian Igo  i The source for everything you ever wanted to know about the SHO  and one of the best auto fan sites I ve seen on the web  is  SHOtimes com   This is an indispensable resource for SHO owners  All of the DIY cheap fixes I mentioned in passing are there  along with an excellent reference on troubleshooting literally dozens of different conditions and great how to instructions for maintenance This may be hazardous to your wealth  but  SHOShop com  is a wonderful and highly recommended source for replacement and aftermarket SHO parts  Excellent stuff at reasonable prices  and the best designed website I ve seen for a speedshop i br br  
Camera, Lately  I ve been in the market for a digital camera  I wanted something that could serve as a scanner and also go with me on my trip to August to Europe  Being a student however  puts a stranglehold on the purse string  I needed something reliable  easy to use  and affordable  Well  I have a found a promising candidate in the OlympusD360L b  The specifications    The Olympus digital camera has 1 3 million pixel resolution with a 2x digital zoom  1 8 Color LCD display  Pictures can be taken in either SHQ  HQ  JPEG  or TIFF format  The camera operates on 8 mb removable smartmedia card with 4 AA batteries  The camera has six different flash modes with a red eye reduction system  There are three different ISO settings at 125 250 500  Spot metering  A panoramic function when using Olympus cards  A serial connection to your commuter  A Timer with a 10 12 second delay b  My research has revealed that    For about  300 dollars this is a very affordable way to enter the digital camera universe  Olympus has made a name for itself in camera  For years it has been successful in producing affordable point and shoot cameras for the beginner  And with this D series line it s evident that Olympus is continuing this tradition with it s digital cameras  If your goal is to find a camera that will allow you to take high quality pictures on the go and work with the pictures online than consider the D360L  Now the lack of an optical zoom or the 1 3 million pixel display will limit you if you are a serious photographer and plan on using this as your primary camera to produce portraits  but if this camera will be your first digital camera or used for all purposes than this is a wonderful choice  Using the 8 mb card you should be able to take around 100 photos using the lowest setting or about 12 using the super high quality setting  I think you ll find that this space gets used up pretty quickly and a larger storage card would be a wise investment  Also  multiple cards will reduce the amount of times you have to unload the photos into your computer  One thing that you ll definitely want to add to your camera purchase is a card reader  Using the serial cable that comes with this camera is extremely slow  The optional card reader eliminates this hassle and makes downloading pictures manageable  The D360L is the next in a series of a very successful digital line from Olympus  What they ve done is improve the ISO settings and the flash modes to increase sharpness and the fight against unnecessary light and red eye  All this at a marginal cost increase proves their commitment to this affordable camera  If your considering purchasing a digital camera then don t overlook the Olympus D360L  At only  299  it s a wonderful way to experience new technology at an affordable price br br  
Auto, Wow  I am so far very impressed with this vehicle  While it only has about 900 miles on it now it has proven itself to be quite capable in any situation I have encountered with it  It is the two door  two wheel drive version  which is the lightest  It has what I consider excellent acceleration for an SUV leaving behind my father s 1994 F150 and my mothers 1999 Suburban easily  In some informal stoplight races it has held its own against those annoying Honda Civics with the exhausts  body kits and ugly graphics all over them  It has proven to be easy to drive in wet conditions easily as well and the four wheel antilock disc brakes do a wonderful job of stopping you  Even if you fishtail in this truck  it is easy to bring back under control  It does not exhibit very much body roll when going through turns  in large part due to the huge sway bar under the front end  it looks like its about two inches around and it does its job very well  The suspension is very tight for a truck  it rides a little bumpy but because of this  it handles very well  It even has bilstein shocks in the back  I originally wanted a leather interior but much to my dissapointment it only comes with cloth in the two door models  However after living with the cloth for a couple of weeks I have decided that it is more comfortable  My mom has leather in her suburban and it isnt as comfortable as my cloth is  the seats are firmer and have less side bolstering if you have the leather seats  I got every option that you could get except for a towing package and this makes it a very nice ride  The audio system is very good for a factory system and comes complete with 6 speakers  I also have the steering wheel mounted audio controls  when I got them I didnt think I would ever use them but now I find that I rarely touch the stereo in the dash other than to change cd s  I have the overhead console that tells such things as average speed  mpg  instant mpg  range  amount of gas used etc  This is rather interesting but I usually only use it to find out the temperature and my average mpg  Speaking of mpg  this thing drinks gas  My previous car was a toyota camry and I was used to getting at the worst around 18 mpg and that was with my foot to the floor constantly  Now  if I drive ultra conservatively I MIGHT be able to get 17 mpg in the city  usually it is more like 15 in the city and 21 on the highway though  While the engine drinks gas  it does put it to good use  put your foot to the floor and you are rewarded with v8 like acceleration  While I do have the lightest model they make and that helps  this engine makes a lot of torque and decent horsepower and is more than adequate for any driving situation  However  if you look at the size of the engine I think there is quite a bit of power left in it and I plan on upgrading to k n cold air induction  freer flowing exhaust and a jet chips control module to pick up some more power  One of the coolest features of this truck is the ability for everything to fold flat from the tailgate to the front seats  you just lift one handle and shove and the back seats both fold flat with the headrest automatically flipping themselves up  It is rather nice and allows you to easily haul large objects  The tow rating of the truck is 5700 lbs  and this is more than adequate for most things including our family boat  I havent towed anything with it yet I didnt get the optional frame mounted hitch but I know it would do a good job  Finally  my favorite features of the car are the excellent four wheel disc brakes with antilock on all 4 wheels  these things stop you quick  and the floor mounted gear selector  I am used to driving a car so it made it very easy for me to transition and I like it better than a column mounted shifter anyway  In short  I think anyone looking for an SUV that can fit into small spaces easily  isnt very large but has adequate room inside  with plenty of power to spare should purchase a Blazer  I m glad I did  
Auto, I ve had my Avalanche for 7 months now  The more I drive it  the less likely I am to drive anything else  I have the Z66  with 2 wheel drive and the 5 7 liter V8  It came with a one year subscription to Onstar  leather seats  heavy duty floor mats  am fm cd player  amazing electric seats  with heaters built in  computerized controls for everything  including oil change intervals I love the appearance of my truck  There s never a shortage of people who want a ride in it  It rides like a cloud down the highway  There are storage compartments on each side of the truck bed with plenty of room for average people  although these probably are not suitable for contractors  The bed covers do keep the bed dry and the bed liner has anti skid characteristics that do keep things from sliding around back there  I have even had a couple of occasions to take mine off road and it handled very well   even though it only has two wheel drive The interior is comfortable and roomy  It will carry 5 adults comfortably  It also has enough storage that I carry way too much stuff around with me I was concerned about reliability and ordered the 70 000 mile warranty  So far  at 26 000 miles  I ve not had any occasion to use the warranty A word about Onstar  I bought my truck new and the Onstar feature  which requires a subscription  came with one year for free  I understand that there are various levels of service you can get  I will renew my basic subscription  I ve locked my keys in the truck twice and Onstar was able to unlock the truck in both instances within 5 minutes with only a short phone call  This feature has a panic button that will automatically dispatch emergency services if you ever need it  And Onstar can track the location of your vehicle if it s stolen I never thought I d own a vehicle with all the features this one has  I absolutely love mine I will share a few of the things that I wish were different  Please don t misconstrue this short list   the benefits of this vehicle far outweigh these minor obstacles First  while the bed covers do keep things dry and add to the overall appearance of the vehicle   they are inconvenient to remove and store  There s a big canvas bag that you can store them in  but when in storage they take up a fair amount of space in the bed  Assuming you took them off to carry something in the bed  you ll be a little disappointed in the amount of room back there Second  this vehicle does not have a lot of excess power  I have found it adequate in all ways  but you can t punch it and get the same acceleration you ll find on lighter trucks Overall  I am a very satisfied driver of a 2002 Chevy Avalanche  If you re looking for a feature laden  very comfortable vehicle with class and style  I highly recommend it  
Camera, The Minolta Dimage 7 is so far the best camera I have ever used  Having a Minolta 35mm camera in the past  this was very easy to get used to  There are two sides to the camera  Beginner and Professional  One side is the camera has automatic exposure and presets for certain events  i e  sunsets and sporting events  which helps if you are new to photography  The other is filled with rich features  such as Shutter Speed  White Balance  and Color Balance  The camera also has 3 types of flash modes  standard flash  red eye reduction  and rear flash sync The resolution has to be the best thing about the camera  It has an astounding resolution of 2560 x 1920 at its maximum image size  Along with the resolution you can control the image quality  Here are the modes of compression for the image quality  all file sizes are for the resolution 2560 x 1920  RAW mode  has to be downloaded through the camera for decoding  this mode gives you the best quality at 9 5mb per picture on the card before decoding  RAW is only saved as a TIFF after it has been decoded  Next is Super Fine mode  which can be saved at 14 1mb per photo  this is saved in a JPG image format  FINE mode  can be saved at 2 1mb per picture  this too is saved as a JPG  Standard mode can be saved at 1 1mb per picture and this too is saved in a JPG format  Last  Economy mode  which can be saved at 0 65mb per image and is saved in a JPG format  Since when you buy the camera they give you a 16mb compact flash card  I would recommend putting the images at 2560 x 1920 and Standard mode for the compression  I have a 256mb compact card which I bought additionally  can hold about 227 images at 2560 x 1920 with Standard mode compression  Why don t I use a better image quality since I have a big card you may ask  I do not see a difference in the photos  With Fine mode and a resolution of 2560 x 1920 I only got 125 images to the 256mb card  I compared photographs taken of the same object at different image qualities and they looked the same  If you really think about it  you re only going to reduce the image anyway when you send it in an email or put it up on a website  As you reduce the image on the computer from the original 2560 x 1920  you will see it will get sharper  Printing from the original image size you will see amazing results  You figure every 100 pixels equals 1 inch  so the original image if you brought it to a print shop  while maintaining the same image quality with out enlarging it would be around 25  x 19 The battery life is okay  On 4 alkaline batteries it lasts about 5 pictures  With the Ni MH batteries  which the camera recommends  can last anywhere from 10 photos to 50 photos  Depending on how much you use the zoom  focus and macro mode The Minolta Dimage 7 has to be the best camera I have ever owned  It has a Beginner s side and a Professional s wanting  I would highly recommend this camera who Is getting started in photography and any professional that wants a inexpensive camera that is loaded with features  
Camera, I recently decided to get involved in the digital photography arena and believe me going into this I had no idea what to look for  Thanks to Epinions and the Internet itself  I was able to do what I believe to be thorough research  My search for the perfect camera to suit my families needs actually began when I decided I need a better over all Printer  That is another story in itself  but I will tell you I ended up purchasing the HP Photosmart 1218 which is the perfect printer for this camera Well  back to this review  After making my decision on the printer  it was time to decide what camera to purchase  Now HP has a line of cameras made specifically for its  PhotoSmart printer but some flags came up in doing my homework on their HP C500  It seems that the reviews I read on it were not favorable at all  Yes  it did have the HP Infrared Jet Scan feature that allows you to send your photos directly to the printer without taking the Card out of the camera  it works much like a remote control does with a TV  but the over all quality of the camera was rated very low for the cost  Now I am a big HP person and I know they stand for quality  but I was not to sure a to their history with camera so I decided to go to the field and see for myself  Much to my surprise  no one locally carried that camera  only the C200 which is quite a step down  That when I came upon the D 490 Zoom  My wife and I played with it alittle at the store and immediately we knew we had to give this camera serious consideration  It had a nice outer look to it  It had both your optical view finder and the basic 1 8 LCD Monitor  that also allows you to zoom in on playback mode which sold my wife  The sliding Lens Cover was a nice benefit although it takes some getting use to  but you can t lose it  The Menu is very easy to follow after looking over the enclosed manual  Best thing of all is I just take my SmartMedia Card out of the camera and pop it right into the built in card reader in my HP PhotoSmart 1218 and WHALLA I ve got photos I never knew it would be so easy  My family and I like to travel  my wife is always asking about taking family portraits  relatives are wanting pictures from time to time and I am very much involved in different activities  Now I can take as many photos whenever and wherever I want  I purchased both an additional 16 MB and 32 MB SmartMedia Card along Rechargeable Battery Kit  We are set to meet our needs for some years now     
Auto, I bought a 1997 plymouth neon new in 1998 right after i graduated from nursing school  I had a 1994 ford escort that i loved  It wasnt too pretty but was tough  I love my little black neon more than that tank of a car escort I had  It has never given me any problems  great on gas mileage and had pretty good pick up  The only thing I would say that I do not care for is the windows  They are sometimes hard to roll down and they dont have a frame so they are noisier than most  The stock stereo is nice with a great sound for the price  Over all I am very pleased with my little neon  especially with the deal I got on it  For a cheaper car it is truly a steal br br  
Camera, This is a great camera  It s easy to use and comes with a great manual and technical support  I called the good folks at Canon for what later turned out to be a misunderstanding on my part  and they were readily available and surprisingly helpful The A20 is designed to be easy to use since it automatically determines shutter speed and exposure  The A20 also uses a 3 pt  auto focus system that helps reduce fuzzy faces from photos  a problem I had often experienced with my previous digital camera The camera is versatile  you are never short on power since it s able to utilize the AA size alkaline batteries that are available worldwide  The Power Shot can also capture up to 500 images using alkaline batteries or up to 1000 images with NiMH batteries  I  like others  found that the AA batteries died out very quickly  This is a negative thing  but the added convenience of a dual power source makes up for it  If you don t have to  you can avoid using AA s until an emergency crops up Another great thing in this camera is the flash  It is excellent  and I read that it provides the highest light output in its class  It s believable Despite an affordable price tag  the camera provides several features normally associated with more expensive models  such as shutter speeds from 1 second to 1 1500 of a second  high precision white balance  and nine image quality modes that help users to choose the perfect level of definition You can store up to 87 images in this camera with the supplied 8MB mem card and then use the USB interface to connect the camera to your Macintosh or PC computer and upload them  The software that was bundled with my A20 included ZoomBrowser EX 2 6  ImageBrowser 1 6 for Mac users  and PhotoStitch 3 1 This is quite simply a great camera  I work at a Circuit City  so I know what the competition holds  For the price and the features  you can t go wrong  
Auto, The 2000 Mountaineer with Monterey options recently replaced our 1997 Mountaineer  the 2000 model offers a much smoother ride and even tighter handling  Thankfully the 2000 doesn t have the ocean swell effect of the 1997  The Monterey package is terrific  excellent leather appointments  good CD Tape Radio system  a terrific climate control system  a moderately helpful read out instrument status display  handy control buttons on the steering wheel  accurate cruise control  power control seats The mileage has settled in around 18 MPG highway driving at 75 MPH  20 MPG at 65 MPH The 8 cylinder engine has plenty of acceleration potential even at high speeds All in all the 2000 is an excellent continuation of the Mountaineer line The only small downsides  the 2000 still doesn t have a lockable glove  or under seat  box  the sunroof seems smaller and is noisier when open than the one in the 1997 The one BIG DOWNSIDE  the leg room for driver and front seat passenger is still marginal forget this vehicle if you OR your passenger is over six foot two  The power controlled seats can perform a slow mo Heimlich on the driver  I m not kidding  but can t move back far enough for my taste  a design flaw since there s plenty of room for back seat passengers     
Camera,  Not recommended for any user  the PDC 640 is a very basic digital camera that is easily surpassed by just about every other camera out there i I received this camera as a gift for Christmas and began to use it fairly regularly afterwards  I had returned it on February 11th because of problems with the LCD display and the fact that you couldn t see the picture anymore   Picture Quality  The picture quality  640x480   no megapixel rating given  on the camera is good enough for web pages and e mail  but does not produce quality prints  For anyone looking for a camera to print pictures from  this is not your camera b Camera Use  I found the use of the LCD display on the camera awkward and clunky  There were no easy ways to get the images to load up on the display  no on off switch  the images would often flicker and the display would often turn itself off while you were trying to navigate the menus  Within a month of fairly active use  the LCD display image began to degrade and breakup  I returned the camera because I was unable to see the images on the LCD display  They would be full of lines and would be all garbled on the display  In addition the lack of an auto focus was a major drawback to this camera  Many of my pictures were blurred beyond use because of the need to select one of three different modes  close up  intermediate  distance  While the image quality was good when the right mode was selected  more often than not I did not think about the mode before I took the picture and later realized that I had been in the wrong mode  In those cases  most of the pictures were lost b Final Thoughts  I would only recommend this camera for a person who is going to use the images for either the web or in e mail  The print quality is not high enough to created quality printed images  However  the awkward controls on the LCD display and the need to choose distance modes would make me wonder if I should recommend this to anyone  If I you were thinking about buying it  I would take it out of the box and try it for yourself b Photography Reviews b i Books and Magazines i a href content 95587765892 Shutterbug Magazine a     a href content 94737174148 Popular Photography Magazine a     a href content 109519933060 PC Photo a     a href content 118512717444 Outdoor Photography a     a href content 120329637508 Photography Outdoors a     a href content 128619810436 American Photo a i Cameras i a href content 102769987204 Olympus C 4000 Digital Camera a     a href content 14022446724 Olympus D 460 Zoom Digital Camera a     a href content 9245200004 Minolta Maxxum 300si  35mm SLR a     a href content 8987512452 Polaroid PDC 640 Digital Camera a     a href content 121532681860 Kodak EasyShare CX4300 Digital Camera a     a href content 121751637636 Canon Elph LT APS Camera a     a href content 122034556548 Olympus Stylus Infinity Zoom 35mm Camera a i Printers  Scanners   Memory  a href content 107691740804 SanDisk 128MB SmartMedia Card a     a href content 118524972676 Memorex 128MB SmartMedia Card a     a href content 119150120580 HP Photosmart 1115 a     a href content 119374974596 Microtek Scanmaker 4800 a     a href content 123388464772 HP Scanjet 3570c a  
Auto, Introduction So what the heck is this thing  Thats what I wondered  I ve never heard of Diatsu  Dhiatsue  or yeah  Daihatsu  That is  until a friend of a friend got one  This is pretty close to  if not  the first mini SUV  Its well worth its weight in Yen So what they heck is it Surprisingly enough  it was imported from Japan by Cadillac  The Rocky was made from 1990 to 1993  It has Dual OverHead Cams DOHC  in a small four cylinder engine  we have never been able to determine the size  it is fairly small  Sadly  Daihatsu has either pulled out of the United States market or they went out of business  I m hoping for the first Pro s Well  lets see  this thing is a very nice little SUV First of all  with the little engine  you can expect well over 30 mpg  probably closer to 35  Once while four wheeling it  we went well below empty sweating  we were  for an estimated total of 500 miles on the gas tank which holds 15 gallons The four wheel drive worked very well  this thing would go anywhere my Blazer would go  and then some This thing was after the heart of the SLK Kompressor lovers  With a removable hardtop in the rear  and a flip up sunroof in the front We don t know the exact mileage  since the speedometer and the odometer haven t worked since they aquired the vehicle in 1995  They have made four round trips to Chicago from the Grand Canyon  and it is a daily driver of at least 20 miles a day  sometimes as much as 200 miles a day twice a month  My estimate is that this vehicle easily has 200 000 miles on it  with nothing mechanically wrong  The spark plugs are very easy to change  with the right wrench  and everything else mechanically speaking is easy to do Even with a not so great 16 year old driver  abusing it daily  this thing is holding up great  I don t know who made the engine  if it was Daihatsu or if they bought premanufactured engines  I d guess that Honda built the engine since it has been so reliable Neutral With the sunroof up on bumpy roads  it rattles  a lot  On smooth roads it is pretty quiet This thing easily seats four people  There isn t much more room than that  but for a compact SUV  what do you expect  There is very little room behind the rear seat The Spare tire somewhat hinders backing view  but nothing to worry about  and not nearly as bad as Jeep Wranglers or  Who the heck makes this  Amigo s Since I think this was Daihatsu first attempt at four wheel drive  Manual hubs are excused  They still suck  and I ve had to get out one too many times in the mud to lock them Cons With a little four banger  do you expect power  I don t  and you certainly don t get it  0 60 as tested in a race against my Blazer is just under 22 seconds  Being the boring town of Grand Canyon  we have little to do but mess with our cars  We even know the 1 4 mile time  21 5 second at 66 mph  For those of you who don t know what this means  between 17 and 19 seconds is average for most family cars  A Corvette will do the quarter mile in 13 3 seconds Never fear  this thing will hold freeway speeds  and highways speeds  just don t try to go up steep inclines at the speed limit Don t expect to tow anything  At least in my Blazer the V6 puts out quite a bit more torque than horsepower 210 torque to 173 hp  in this  thats not the case  My guess is about 100 horsepower  and 100 ft  lbs  of torque  It can barely pull around four average males  let alone any size trailer Overall This little SUV is ideal for college students that want a little bit of attitude to their Geo  It will go anywhere  muddy or not  and we have never felt that we compromised our safety while  quot romping quot  it If you don t mind being slow  but getting great gas mileage  this is for you  The reliability is great  the comfort is too  just don t plan on hauling all of your friends and all of their stuff around br br  
Auto, Can someone please explain to me what in forsaken name is wrong with American cars  Am I so periodically pulled to these vehicles only on the grounds that I was born in this country  I honestly can say as an American that I have found enough grave reservations to diagnose a Pontiac Grand AM  any year  with an  identity crisis  How confident did I feel as a young  avid student when I first purchased my 1995 SEII Pontiac   Consisted of  SEII sports package V6  3 1L engine 16  wheels  slightly better suspension roof rack splash guards automatic everything Almost GT version It is only now that I have given myself the benefit of the doubt that this really is a bad car  I purchased it used from a woman that swore she drove like a Nun  I could believe that because she looked incapable of the kind of ingret to take a sports coupe off roading in the woods of greater Maine  Or was she  Anyhow  I took this insipid  but yet sporty and near mint condition vehicle with me to Colorado  Shouldn t sports  cars be more than willing to take the rigors and punishment of a state set on the foundations of four wheel drive  Sure  why not  right  About three days later  a fuel injector failed  quite violently  I literally had to break the leg of the dealership to get them to fix the problem  which they wanted to charge  500 00 for the project  That was fixed and I was baffled  Several thousand miles later the fuel latch began to fail regularly  The car has now 65 000  one cannot even begin to imagine the despair and anguish I had to go threw by  slamming  and modifying that latch just to get it to close  cold days  anyone  Has anyone ever witnessed their automatic door mechanism have a malfunction  Well  for Harvard s sake  lets just say that now I open and close my door MANUALLY by sticking in a rolled paper towel between the spindle and eye  The automatic device on that car is as reliable as a three legged ox  I also hope that I am the only one that notices the passenger side window close lethargically slower than the driver s side  I even went the extra step to clock the turtle like speed of that window  The driver and passenger side should never race  let alone close AT THE SAME TIME  After 65 000 miles  the engine will now vibrate with a precarious  but yet predictable demeanor  Shaking after 65 000 miles   good God  I have never raced this car in my life  I treat it like the girlfriend I always wanted  Can someone also explain why this Pontiac Grand  Scam s  speakers had to also malfunction  Never playing music loud  ever  I took witness to both of my GM issue front speakers disappoint me when they decided to leave my life indefinitely  The refuse failed and now I only have two operating speakers  go figure  The only aspect of the car that I feel confident about is the coherent looks  It has some very stylish Enkei RS Evolution wheels  about  2000 00  that I basically got free  and a nice wind shield stripe  Too bad this will not conceal its image into a Ferrari  Anyhow  I feel demoralized about buying this car since I do so much to keep it in top condition  The resale value is enough to drive someone insane since I almost paid about  10 000 for it  very little profitable return  Please be careful when buying a vehicle  American  because one will not know what one is getting into when endeavoring in such a dangerous  mission  Now when I think about it  every car that I have owned was either GM or Ford  about six cars in all  and not one has been reliable after 100 000 miles  What does this tell you Art  Please be very careful and aware of the endless options of purchasing a good vehicle  Godspeed and happy hunting Art SnowFalcon 
Camera, KODAK DC3400 Digital Camera Compusa  540 I was impressed with my first digital camera   KODAK DC210   which I bought two years ago  It died this summer  Despite advice from the Kodak help line it proved impossible for me to resurrect it and the cost of sending it to the regional repair centre  would you believe that from the UK it would have to be sent to Belgium  came close to the cost of buying a new one I chose an updated version that offered higher resolution and many new features  These are my first impressions  For the uninitiated  a digital camera does not use conventional film  but rather uses a memory chip to store the images  The camera comes with a range of cables for connection to the serial  or USB  port of a computer or a TV monitor  It uses 4 AA batteries  has an optional rechargeable battery option  and for static work has a mains adapter  The camera is rated at 2 0 megapixels  1760 x 1180  of picture resolution  twice that of my old one  but lagging behind the high end of the range at over 3 megapixels  This latter is said to equal that of 35 mm film  For snap shots the resolution can be cut from high to low  It has a zoom lens ranging from 38 to 76 mm and an aperture rating from f3 1 to f10 3  There is also an autofocusing mechanism  Images are stored in a Kodak version of JPEG format  The video output can be adjusted between NTSC and PAL There are a range of Kodak Compactflash cards  10Mb to 128 Mb  The number of images stored depends on the on the resolution chosen  The supplied 16Mb card stores 18  the 96 Mb card 90 The camera uses a menu system which is displayed on the view screen at the rear  It can operate in capture mode  review images  connect to a computer or set up  The supplied manual is quite detailed using simple steps to guide through the various operations  There is a built in date   time stamp  It is possible to add borders and use special effects such as black and white or sepia tones  Software to transfer and manipulate images on a PCF or Macintosh is also supplied which are very simple to use  There is a wide range of optional extras including Compactflash Card readers  said to be 50 times faster at transferring images to a computer than serial cable  higher power telephoto lenses and creative filter kits  The battery charger comes with a range of plugs that will fit sockets around the world I connected my camera to my computer  photo quality printer and Iomega Zip drive using a USB Hub  I was amazed how easy this  plug and play  facility is  The computer recognised the camera  hot  The software downloaded from the provided CD ROM without difficulty   ONE TIP  If like me you have an older camera be sure to use the uninstall facility to get rid of the software and to free up the camera port   there doesn t seem to be any other way to do it The software gives easy access to the pictures on the Compactflash card  Retitling is straightforward and there are all manner of facilities to manipulate the image and correct minor exposure problems  Storage of the jpg files on a ZIP drive is simplicity itself  I decided to buy an HP Photosmart printer  I have been absolutely delighted and truly amazed with the results from this camera   printer combination  Focus is pin sharp  colours are deep and rich  It has reawakened in me an interest in photgraphy lost since the demise of my SLR Many stores now have a facility for D I Y printing by merely putting the flash card in to a slot in the apparatus  There are also facilities for transferring JPEG files over the internet to photographic bureaus and receiving hard copy back by mail Downsides  I guess Kodak now have so many digital camera models each with its own specific version of software that life is getting a bit confusing for retailer and end user  Compusa was unable to tell me for instance whether I could use the mains adapter and other cables from my previous camera  as it happens I can   but you need to access Kodak s website for a formal compatibility list  Overall impression  Rather more expensive than the previous model   but you get what you pay for  However it is simplicity itself to use  It is compact  lightweight and can be taken  almost  anywhere  Yes   I recommend this camera for the more serious amateur digital photographer or as the base camera for a small business  
Camera, I chose the Kodak DC 210 over a couple of others for several reasons 1  It uses inexpensive batteries   4 AAs 2  It uses a flashcard which can be read by a usb reader 3  It looks like a normal camera from the front 4  The price was better than many other cameras I have done photography professionally in the past and so when I began looking for a digital camera I wanted something that was in my price range and yet would give me reasonably high quality photos Once I actually got the camera in my hands I was impressed  The actual size of the pictures at the highest resolution is huge  In addition  by using the basic software  I discovered that I could get pretty incredible enlargements  In fact I have found that for web applications I have to reduce the lowest resolution size even more for it to upload and download quickly  My particular camera came with additional software  Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2 0 and Pagemill 2 0  These applications are helpful and pretty simple to use Overall I have really enjoyed and appreciated the ease and quality of this camera  In truth the only real gripes that I have are pretty minor  1  You have to save the pictures into a different format to use them in any program other than the Kodak programs 2  The camera is somewhat heavy for its size making long shoots without a tripod a little difficult 3  The power button is a little to close to the shutter button Last of all you need to decide before you purchase a camera what exactly you need in the camera and what you can live with  Then look long and hard at all of the ones currently on the market  Don t just run out to get a camera because someone else has one  Check out epinions and ask around about each camera you are interested in  Remember that an expensive camera that doesn t do what you need or want is pretty worthless Above all  have fun with your camera     
Camera, As a person who never gets around to developing film  I thought a digital camera would be a great thing to have  I found this little guy at Walmart for under  200 00  and was impressed with what features it has  The resolution compares with much more expensive cameras  In fact  the only other cameras in this price range were only 640X480 or less  The results are clear and crisp  and if printed on photo paper  look just as good printed The only downside is the lack of a manual  on screen help is worthless if you re not taking pictures in the house  and the icons on the camera s menu aren t really user friendly  The color lcd screen is bright and sharp  except for outside in strong light  and the picture preview is handy  You can delete a shot instantly if it doesn t look right  and free up the memory for another picture  You can also hook this to your tv or vcr with the provided cable and preview pictures  save them on tape  or even use the camera as a low quality cam corder  if you don t mind filming all the action within a 5  radius of the vcr  due to cord length Also handy is the separate black and white lcd on the top of the camera  It has a battery level indicator  displays what resolution your pictures are in  Fine  Very Fine  and Normal  and how many shots are left in each mode  The higher the quality  the less shots the memory will hold  On the main menu  accessed on the color screen  you can set the quality to XGA or VGA  XGA being the best  So you end up having access to 6 different film quality settings  with XGA Very fine being the best  and VGA Normal being the lowest quality  but still very adequate  The flash mode indicator is also on the top lcd  off  on  and auto  Even inside you don t need to use the flash very often  due to the fact that you can also choose the available lighting level on the main menu  sunlight  lamp light  etc  The indoor shots I did use the flash on came out overexposed until I turned the flash completely off  then they were perfect I d recommend this for anyone that wants a digital camera  but doesn t need all the high end options on more expensive models br br  
Camera, I was looking for a digital camera for quite some time  I wanted one that was easy to carry and care for  would fit compactly into my brief bag  and would be priced properly to make it worth my while to use and send digital images over the internet  One day I entered my needed specifications into a website to search for that camera and only one resulted  It was the PDC640 by Polaroid Corporation  I found one and bought it  I have used this camera almost daily for approximately 5 months now  I take  sometimes  up to 10 pix a day x 5 days a week  With the program provided I can quickly download these pictures and send them on their way with my faxed report  I am a Realtor and I use my camera for business  It has not failed my and for the under  300 price it fit perfectly into my expense structure  It beats developing a partial film  scanning to a disk  then e mailing it  I save a bunch br br  
Camera, The exterior of the camera is very nice       Sleek looking and professional  It s portable and light  fitting easily in a pocket  A plus for the weekend photographer  Unfortunately  being a mother of three  a camera at the ready is a necessity  This particular tool takes a few seconds to set the ideal shooting option  and if it sits idle for only a short time it automatically shuts off  which is a plus as far as battery preservation  but forces you to have to go through the process of turning the camera on and picking the shooting option again before actually taking the picture  This can be frustrating when taking pictures of kids who are always on the go  I have also found that there is a problem with quality pictures  and there seems to be a toss up as to whether the picture will turn out clear  or blurry  I have found it takes clear pictures more consistently outdoors than in  and if the lighting is ideal  It does hold up to 70 pictures  and has a very bright flash  which helps with some of the blurry indoor pictures a bit The camera does double as a web cam  which I find is ideal  It comes with a photo program  ArcSoft Photo Impression  That is simple to use  allowing you to not only view and alter pictures that you have taken away from the computer  but also shoots live videos and gives you the opportunity  If your computer and video card allows  to make movies with the AVI maker  It only takes 2 AA batteries which last a long time thanks to the battery saver feature that shuts off the camera when it is idle for a short period of time  It connects to the computer by USB port  I had to replace the port after a small household accident on my part  When I went to replace it  I found that both ends of the cable were identical  which posed a problem  I ended up having to go to a computer specific store to find the correct cable to replace the one I broke  
Camera, Quick update December 2003 About 3 500 photos on and it s still going strong  It s not had a rough life  but I take it  everywhere  I go  and has been dropped a few times onto carpeted floor accidentally  and survived I ve added more memory cards  they re only US 40 now  It s still a shame that smartmedia s limit is 128MB  but that s enough for 150 high quality pix  Some memory cards are definitely faster than others  so it s worth looking at better brands  Apparently power consumption can vary by 75  too  but I can t tell you how to determine the best card as the full technical specifications are rarely published  all I can say is that with the small difference in prices when buying online  to go for a good name brand My father has now gone digital and bought a Canon A60  Although in theory his camera should be better  the images are noticeably very slightly worse especially in poorer light  I was puzzled by this  naturally  as I thought technology should have moved on After some investigation I found out that not only have very few mid range digital cameras matched the lens that Olympus fitted to the C3040Z and its replacements  but in this model Oly fitted a 1 1 8  ccd image sensor  whilst other manufacturers were fitting and have continued to fit smaller sensors  the extra 30  area increase over the 1 2 5  and f1 8 vs the typical f2 6 lens means there s more light for the sensor to work without noise In practise  from what I ve read  3M to 4M is about the optical limit of resolution for typical digicam CCDs and their lenses   it s only when you get to the larger sizes used by the SLR type cameras and the quality of lenses  adding more pixels to the sensors simply gives each one less light  and the smaller lenses simply don t have the resolution Update 29th May 2002 I have now lived with my 3040Z for a year and have a few more things to add Firstly  memory  The Oly uses smartmedia  which I think is a dying format  as Compact Flash seems to be the way of the future  So  my advice is to make sure you buy at least one spare card if you re ever going to need it The largest sm card you can buy is still only 128MB  which I think is a design limit  though CF now goes up to 1GB  However  the card does hold  150 pictures in high quality mode  these are 700K per image  roughly  the picture quality in this mode is very good  more than good enough to print a 10x8  New cards are now less than  60 for third party makes  but then you don t get the panorama feature  I m told that Oly have a special firmware fix to make their cards do something special to enable panorama feature  that you would with Oly media  I ve got two 128MB cards  one is Oly  and the original Oly 8MB which came from the camera  and only twice ever had to use the 2nd card  so it s not a big deal  I sometimes used my Olympus to store downloaded files  there s a leased line at work  and I only have a modem at home  hence would like bigger memory Secondly  speed  The small delay when you press the shutter button has been a bit of a niggle  it s ok when taking portraits  landscapes etc  but for motorsport it requires a lot of practise to anticipate  You can help by pre focussing  but you end up taking a lot of bad pictures  My advice is  before buying any digital camera  to try and borrow one of that type from a friend to see if you can live with it  I ve learned to live and love  despite faults  my Oly Thirdly  3rd party s w  I have discovered a really nifty bit of Windows software which allows you to remote control your Olympus camera  and do things like time lapse photography  reconfigure it etc  Find it at http www pinetreecomputing com camctl asp Finding this program was a real blessing  I love it  You ll be wanting a mains adaptor if you want to do any time lapse photography though Apart from that  my 3040Z has been trouble free despite getting quite wet at times  has only ever had one corrupted picture  low battery  so my fault  and many people have commented on the good picture quality  I still recommend it  Reviews of the 4040Z indicate that the extra resolution doesn t give you a benefit  because the size of the lens and the CCD is the limiting factor  However  they have improved the firmware  so unless you re not saving a packet  the 3040Z will probably do everything you want and probably is much better value for money than the 4040Z Some sample photos from my vacation last year in California here  http paul motorbiking fotopic net show collection php id 1982 I made no special attempts to clean up these photos  they have only been cropped I have now lived with my Oly 3040Z for two months and taken a wide variety of pictures with it and a few motion jpeg movies  I have taken pictures in normal daylight  dusk  and night time  and generally been quite impressed I would agree with other s findings that the flash can often over expose  it s easy to tweak it down to  0 3 in the menus  so it s not really a big deal I bought the camera with a second genuine olympus 128MB memory card  as only Olympus memory has a specific feature allowing panorama stitching  When I last looked  late May 2001  Olympus memory cards were about 30  more expensive than standard ones I tried the Camedia Master software which came with the camera  on both my Windows 2000 machine  a laptop  and desktop Win98  and it is ok except neither machine recognise the camera is connected  so I can t do any fancy setup tricks  However  you can crop  rotate  not lossless I think  and resize pictures  and save with different quality levels  There s also a  panorama  stitch feature in the software  which I haven t used which automates the process a bit  Overall I would recommend instead using  irfanview  or ACDSEE  search http www tucows com for them  as both support lossless jpeg rotation  irfanview needs some plugins for this The movie file format is motion jpeg  and you play it with Quicktime  http quicktime apple com  The camera allows you to change the start and end of the movie  creating a new movie or overwriting the old one  which is handy if you don t have any quicktime editing software  The free quicktime player doesn t allow this  the paid for one does  Pros Excellent picture quality and excellent lens  and you can get adaptor to allow use of video camera tele wide adaptors  I have a 2x tele converter  and a 0 5x wideangle converter  these are about GBP100 or USD140 each for reasonable quality items Good battery life   takes 4 AA batteries  so you can buy spares in any store if you ve run down your rechargeables  and much cheaper to buy extra rechargeable batteries than say camcorder ones  It also means you can use the same charger  which helps when you go on holiday  The genuine Olympus charger is quite good  and is universal voltage  even though the pack doesn t say so  you don t even have to remember to switch it over Automatic mode is relatively foolproof   it gets it right most of the time  and a little practise with the exposure lock means 99  of my photos were easy Semi auto and manual exposure modes are useful  but I found the exposure lock to be good enough so I don t need to change modes much at all Has manual focus and focus lock option  occasionally useful  though manual focus is quite fiddly and would take too long to use for anything other than still life It takes pictures quickly  and is ready for the next shot in seconds  EXCEPT IN RAW TIFF MODE The video  motion jpeg  is fun and occasionally useful  and you can edit the movie in the camera very easily Very easy to connect to computer  I use Windows 2000  just plug into USB port  and the cable is supplied Flash sync modes allow trick night time photos   first or second curtain in slow flash sync mode  There s a tiny connector for an external flash gun  which might be very useful Can connect to TV or VCR to make a slideshow tape  mono sound  composite video only    the lead is supplied remembers your settings including all the customisations and is easy to reset back to factory the tripod screw hole is nice and robust  and central the battery compartment locks securely the LCD screen is easily viewable in daylight  you only need to shield it a little bit in sunlight  Cons Doesn t come with rechargeable batteries  but given it uses four AA cells  these are quite cheap from any decent store like Frys or BestBuy   make sure you get at least 1200mAH capacity cells though  I bought the real Olympus ones with the Oly charger  which are 1400mAH capacity and last a very long time Viewfinder is slightly awkward at first Like other digital cameras  pressing shutter button isn t immediate The video  motion jpeg  takes just a bit too long to start up to be useful for spontaneous  filming I couldn t switch between NTSC and PAL video out  so beware if you buy abroad where video system is different  Most new TVs in Europe will accept NTSC  but you can t record with a VCR of course unless you buy an expensive  GBP100 or more  converter Raw TIFF mode is very slow  which is to be expected Front element of lens is hardly recessed  and it s not possible to protect with a filter  so you do need to be careful when handling  The lens cap can fall off easily  so I ve managed to put some big juicy fingerprints on the lens when the cap has fallen off and I m groping inside the camera bag When connected to TV  the slideshow always has some overlay of information which spoils the presentation a little  and it can take a while to flick between pages   there s a blank screen for a significant fraction of a second The bottom line  As good as anything I ll ever want  
Auto, My interest in this marquee started out with the earlier Range Rover Model  I was quite interested in acquiring what had been dubbed the  quot The most competent four wheel drive vehicle in the world quot However  I was left with a lot of doubt as to the credibility of this rather desirable automobile  First reason for doubt was the Range Rover s dubious and rather shameful reliability  This so called competent mud rucker had not endeared itself to owners all over the world with it s dubious track record on reliability  In fact  as I was hunting around for a bargain basement used   or as we say now  pre owned Range Rover  I found myself being deterred by   of all people   car dealers all over  I then went to a trusted friend in Studio City to try to acquire this vehicle that I desired  He bluntly refused to sell me the one he had actually owned  this from a guy who treated his automobiles almost as a substitute for children  He regaled me with horror stories of trying to keep his Range Rover serviceable  infact he stated that he would never buy a Range Rover that was out of warranty  So  after feeling rather let down in my quest to acquire this automobile  I was to come to face another issue I had with the Range Rover  For an over  50 000 luxury automobile  it was small inside  I am 6 3 quot  tall  and can compete with most professional quarterbacks for build  I was rather disappointed by this  I don t know about you  however if I am paying that much money for a car  I would like to be able to enjoy it  and I mean really enjoy  I am not just acquiring the Range Rover to prove my social worth or accomplishments  or to say that I appreciate crumpets and tea or a game of Polo  Also  it was not to grin in pain at my neighbours as I come home from LA s infamous traffic jams with my knees having lost all sensation by the time I come home  However  almost like a call to me from the Marquee s manufacturer  a second edition of the Range Rover was released  This was the Range Rover Town and Country LWB  Long Wheel Base  I found from test driving this car that there was more room for Daddy Long Legs   Me  at last it seemed I would be able to enjoy this luxurious marquee  However  based on the dismal reputation that the Range Rover seemed to have built thus far  I found my desire to acquire this vehicle was not enough to make me fork out the mulla to buy it The beginning of this review was based on the past  Rover has now introduced the new Range Rover  and it has been with us for a few years now  fewer years than our cousins in Queen s country have had the new Range Rover  I have again found my desire for this majestic mud rucker piqued  The new Range Rover now has a fair amount of pre owned examples to choose from  therefore I decided to again go out and try to quell my desire Initially  I was not too taken by the look of the new Range Rover  it somehow seemed bland in design  Almost as generic as a lot of new automobiles seemed to be during the late eighties into the nineties  However  as time went on as I started to pay a closer look at this marquee  I realized that Range Rover had actually created a new Range Rover while preserving the traditional look and dare I say lines of the older model  It was more of an evolutionary design if not wildly revolutionary  As time wore on  I also realized it was actually distinguishable from other SUV s on the road  if you did not recognize Her Majesty s official mudrucker by it s new design  then I found you could hardly miss it s share size  It had presence and visual dominance on the road when it appeared  and at the same time  it exuded it s elegance and class  I often joked that it was what a Suburban would look like in a tuxedo  it was James Bond on steroids After deciding that the new Range Rover had a face that not only a mother could love  but one that I had come to appreciate  I decided that it was time for me to go put it through it s paces  Now what I wanted was to be able to spend a bundle of hard earned dollars on an SUV that would make me feel like royalty forgive the pun  But this vehicle had to be reliable enough to where it would need a third mortgage to maintain   the second mortgage bought it  It also had to be comfortable enough as a long distance hauler and a traffic jam haven  Now  I did mention the part of feeling like royalty  well  no doubt a lot of people will say this is a trait of and Angeleno  but I wanted my SUV to have enough snob appeal to say class without being  to crass  I first began my quest by researching the new Range Rover s reliability  Much to by delight  it was rave reviews all the way  Things like  quot  I have been delighted with the performance of my Rover to date quot  and this would be two to three years later  Or from my dear friend in Studio City   quot I am glad that I decided to try another Rover  for once I did not have to wear out my warranty quot  So with this positive feedback already on the side of the new Range Rover  I went in search of the ideal candidate to literally fill my garage  I also went to a couple of large Range Rover dealers to see if I can obtain an even more knowledgeable review of the car s reliability  Even though I was expecting to get somewhat biased reviews  I was still pleased to hear that the car was indeed proving it s reliability  When I went out in search of my ideal candidate  I was quite in amazed at the number of Range Rovers available to the used car buyer  and also the asking price for them  To say that depreciation was rather harsh to this automobile would be an understatement to me  I found quite a handful of Range Rovers ranging in age between 18 months to two years old  The average mileage was between 38 000 to 50 000 miles  To me  the examples I found were quite clean and well kept  After all  the truth of the matter is that not all of us can afford these marquees new  The prices I found ranged from  32 000 for newer ones with lower miles to  29 000 for slightly older ones with mileage in the high forties to fifties  I thought this was not a bad deal  considering this meant up to  20 000 less than a new one  and they still looked in impeccable condition  Even the examples I found at the larger Range Rover dealerships were only a little bit more expensive than the ones I found here and there A BIT OF THE OLE WRITER S BLOCK HERE  SINCERE APOLOGIES  I WILL FINISH THIS SOON  THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE     
Camera, After doing a lot of searching on the  net and looking at what some of my friends were using the Olympus was definitely the way to go  My only complaints are the smallish memory card that is provided  and the fact that the lens cap provides a problem if you forget to take it off before turning it on  I looked at the Nikon 885 and 995 as well as the Canon S30 and S40  Definitely go to Circuit City or Best Buy to play with these cameras  I chose the Olympus when you consider the Nikon will shoot QuickTime movies but without sound  the Canon will shoot movies with sound  The Canon s port cover seemed very flimsy  I d probably break in under a month  Probably the other leg up Nikon and Canon had was the use of Compact Flash  more durable  vice Smart Media card  But if you re banging your camera around I think you ll have other issues before the memory durability becomes a problem  As far as image quality goes I m sure they are all in about the same league so the cosmetics were the key for me  Also liked the ability to use add on lenses  no go for the Canon  Software looks like it will be very good  I especially like the fact that the Macintosh software isn t some stripped down 3 year old version  Image transfer was flawless once I downloaded the USB Mass Storage drive 1 3 5 from Apple  The was also pointed out in the manual  very comprehensive  The only nitpicky thing I saw was the fact that you need the Olympus cards to shoot panoramic photos no third party cards  The photos that I ve taken are sharp and clear  And of course if you don t like the shot  delete it  I had the camera out of the box and was shooting photos in under 5 minutes  The fast lens and quick cycle times are great when you ve got children who rarely wait for the camera to cycle   Bottom line b  This is a great camera especially for the price that I paid  I recommend it to anyone with our reservation  
Camera, We purchased this product to replace our casio digital camera  After researching the camera s for a very long time  we were off to purchase the Sony MVC FD91 Having our own business  we do alot of presentations  quotes  etc  So  we needed a camera that could take a high quality picture  We also travel a great deal  so we needed something that could take nice pictures of where we have been  what we have seen  etc  This camera was the best choice for what we needed wanted The reasons we chose this camera  The 14X zoom  floppy disk storage  MPEG capabilities  rechargable battery  resolution of the pictures  built in flash  and the camera is simple to use     
Camera, I purchased the Canon S100 Digital Elph just 30 days ago  after taking 1 190 pictures I love it even more than the first week I used it  The camera s first real test came on a ski trip to Winter Park Colorado  Let me tell you how rugged this little all metal camera is  I took an awful spill  head first at high speed landing directly on the camera which was tucked into my breast pocket   I am 180  lbs  The camera functioned perfectly there after and for the rest of the trip in cold weather conditions  I did not really know what to expect from a  travel camera  having never owned any type of camera before  I was very delighted with the results  I purchased an extra battery and a 64MB CF card  highly recommended  for this extended trip  I shot most of the pictures in the larger size 1600X1200 and reduced them to fit my laptop screen after filling up the CF card  110  pictures  I experimented with the manual camera settings  which are minimal  but that is OK  as I have heard that some outdoor images can be dark in nature  Here is what I did to achieve good to great image quality  Most images  90  were shot in manual mode  Use sunny cloudy as need outdoors  auto white balance 1 3 EV   w flash indoors  Most images were conditioned  takes about 1 sec  with the Thumbs  Software  hit  shift G  That was the only enhancement done  Note   Most images that are  too dark  were taken in auto mode  especially outdoor pics  These settings thus far have produced prints that are indistinguishable from photo chemical prints  usually better  Images larger than 640 were resized from 1600 X 1200  using TH  to 1024 or 800 to better accommodate most displays  What I love most about this camera is the super portable size  We got many shots that we never would have taken with my wife s  large  35mm camera  In retrospect some of those snaps were the best pics of the lot  I highly recommend this camera with the following options considered as mandatory  PCMCIA card for downloading pictures to laptop 64MB CF card 2nd battery 15 00 Canon Powershot case Thumbs plus v4 software to quickly enhance pictures  PRINTING Seeing the prints is what will really impress you about this camera  I don t own a printer  I use  www ofoto com  to process my hard copies  I have tried others and they are the Cadillac IF seeing is believing look at the following images on my page http 68 41 82 57 82 canons100 web page1 html 
Camera, I had the opportunity to borrow a friend s Mavica for a trip to Mexico two years ago  I fell in love with the camera  Nothing could be easier  Slip a floppy in take a picture  check the picture  if it s no good  delete the picture  And when the disk is full  you ve got all GOOD pictures  And I do mean good  It will make you look like a professional  Amazing close up shots  amazing zoom shots  Amazing sunsets  Gorgeous colors  Clarity is very  very good  I bought my Mavica last summer  and since then have convinced three other people they couldn t live without one  There is nothing I dislike about this camera br br  
Auto, As a recent purchaser of the Dodge Durango I would like to give it my whole hearted thumbs up  My previous vehicle  a 1997 Chevy Blazer is a downright slug in comparison  The handle and performance of the Durango are for superior  and it just has a much better feel on the road  Living where we do in British Columbia we encounter all types of road conditions from dry paved to snow covered dirt and the Durango eats them all up  Another feature which although seems very simple is one of the best I have seen is the placement of the Stereo Controls on the back of the steering wheel  this enable you to make adjustments without your hands leaving the wheel or eyes leaving the road  The only problem I have encountered is keep the keys in my pocket as opposed to my wives     
Auto, I was narrowing down my choices to either get a BMW 735i or a Lexus SC400  I decided on the BMW  Since I bought it I changed the exhaust  strut cartridges  a fog light  and some hoses  I still need to get the light for the onboard computer changed  it works  but it appears dim  to get the bulb replaced will take about 2 hours  BMW quoted it as being around  200 worth of labor to replace a  1 part  You should only buy this type of car  or any luxury car  if you can afford to maintain it  The muffler for the car was  600  for my Chrysler it was  30  Is the car worth the price  Yes  The car has many features  such as heated seats  lumbar support  it even has a radio station built in that gives you weather  WB   Weather Band  The car has a lot of room  for both front and rear passengers  I like the dual climate controls for the driver and passenger side  as well as a feature that allows you to close the windows and sunroof from the outside of the car using the doorlock  The cars acceleration is also very fast  It has a 6 cylinder engine  but can easily beat an 8 cylinder car  When I merge onto the highway I put the car in 3rd gear  which lights up an  quot s quot  on the dashboard meaning that it is in sports gear  in this gear the car accelerates tremendously  The braking is also very good  I went from 55 to a stop in a couple seconds  without skidding  The traction control makes driving in rain like driving on a dry road  Although the car is costly  you get what you pay for     
Camera, I received the s20 as a graduation gift from college  It is my first digital camera  but I have worked a lot with conventional photography The most notable feature of the s20 is that it defies the current industry paradigm of choosing between size and quality  It may not have the best quality out there  although 3 3 megapixels is phenomenal  but it is smaller than most point and shoot 35mm or even APS cameras  This allows it to take pictures of astonishing quality  but be used as a daytrip go anywhere camera  This  in my opinion  is its greatest strength Even at medium quality with medium compression  it takes 1024x768 photos  44 to a 16mb flash card  of excellent quality  In its highest quality mode  the pictures don t even come close to fitting on my 1600x1200 resolution computer screen  Simply amazing It has several impressive features as well  While you can put it in automatic mode where the camera chooses everything  I have always been most enamored of cameras that allow you to control the elements of the construction of the picture as well  The Canon S20 does it all   It supports rapid shooting  multi frame  single frame shooting  and timer modes   It has automatic  sunlight  and indoor color balancing modes  a feat conventional cameras can only achieve through different films and filters It has 4 flash modes  automatic  red eye reduction  no flash and force flash  flash no matter what It supports free zoom between 6 5 and 13mm and a macro mode for close up shots Its rear display is bright and clear even in sunlight and can be turned on or off depending on how much battery life is a concern to you As far as construction goes  the entire housing of the camera is metal  giving you the feeling of a durable camera  but the whole package remains light and small enough to fit in your pocket In the 5 months I ve owned mine  I have taken hundreds of pictures  and the camera has never failed to capture even the most difficult lighting conditions to my satisfaction  All in all  I would suggest this camera to anyone wanting to buy a digital camera provided it falls within your budget  The  800 price tag is quite hefty br br  
Camera, Like many others  I bought this camera as a low cost way to start taking digital pictures  299 during summer of 1999  I also really liked the picture transfer method  the files are stored on a small card that can be inserted into a floppy adapter and used in your computer like a 3 5 quot  drive  No cables  Also it comes with an AC adapter  which I found was extra for most other cameras  Turns out I never use the adapter though The missing features that I was willing to overlook were lack of zoom  and 640x480 max resolution  I find that 640x480 is just fine for me  I just want pictures I can put on the Web  I m not really a photography enthusiast It is the missing feature that I accidentally overlooked that has made me somewhat unhappy with this camera  NO AUTOFOCUS  There are 3 manual focus settings  close up  medium  and far away  If you do not switch to the appropriate setting  you are pretty much guaranteed to get a blurry picture  It might not be so hard to remember this if the view in the viewfinder was blurry too  but it is just a small glass window that doesn t go through the lens  so it always looks fine  So I use the wrong setting about 20  of the time I still think this is a decent camera  The viewfinder looks good  battery lasts pretty well  and again  the price is right  The focus is really my only complaint  but it is a big one  So unless you have a great memory or take pictures from the exact same distance all the time  be ready for a few blurry disappointments Oh  one more problem  The floppy adapter drivers do not work with Windows NT  I have to download the pictures on my girlfriends Windows 95 computer instead of my NT one NEW ADDITION  08 16 2000  My camera just broke after 14 months  2 months after the warranty expired  I now despise this camera br br  
Camera, One of my volunteer tasks is editing and producing a 12 page monthly newsletter for our lake community club  As an ad agency owner with graphics arts and public relations experience  I took it from a rough paste up copier job to a fully digitized publication  One objective was heavy use of human interest photos  Conventional photography and scanning created a time lag and represented unnecessary steps  After shopping around  I purchased a Toshiba PDR M 3  It met my basic criteria  through the lens viewing  as well as LCD monitor  to conserve power  photo quality  good storage and  quot point and shoot quot  convenience  It did all I wanted and more  Quality and color are exceptional  comparing favorably with better traditional cameras  It is easy to learn and use  An optional feature called  quot Flashpath quot  makes it possible to download pictures from the camera s memory chip to computer via the floppy disk drive  One feature shows thumbnails along the side of your screen which may be dragged and dropped to your graphics program or application of choice  In addition to publication work  I ve used the camera successfully for a community web site  print ad photos and product shots  Whether it s for personal photos  e mail sharing or graphic arts  we recommend this camera as a dependable workhorse  at a realistic cost     
Auto, My wife and I recently acquired a used 1996 Ford Contour  We were looking for something else but the car dealer convinced us this was  quot the car for us quot  This car has given us nothing but trouble  It has been recalled twice  The speakers are the current problem  The right speakers will periodically stop working  In addition to that the bass has never been really good but I do like to have a system that can at least vibrate the car a little  The bass levels at their highest setting will give most rap songs a little beat but not a boost or a bang  We have also had problems with the air conditioner and the brakes within less than a year from when we bought it  It also does not get good gas mileage  We have to refill at least once a week  We are looking for a way to affordably get rid of it  In all fairness  I may be a little bias because I use to own an 86 Ford Escort and it gave me a large amount of problems and cost me too much money  After the Escort I have developed a negative opinion towards and Ford compact car but this Contour is proving my opinion right  I was hoping that I was wrong about how bad Ford cars are but the Ford Contour that we bought has proven me more right than ever before  Positive comments  Well it does have excellent pick up or  quot get up and go quot  That may attribute to the bad gas mileage  This car is great for those guys who like to race little old ladies at the red light  It will most definitely beat most small cars  buses  and semi trucks  My opinion of this car and most Ford cars is that they are prone to failure  Don t sneeze near it or kick the tires or else it could fall apart  Maybe Ford s just don t like me     
Camera, I purchased a PDC 700 camera at a clearance sale 8 months ago for  99  It came with some accessories such as a case  three cables USB Serial TV Out  AC Adapter  and all software  First I must say that I was not looking for a high price  high resolution camera  I wanted something I could take some auction photos and fun shots with  The sub  100 cameras at the time were not up to my standards  but this one which listed at  249 was  It s easy to install  and with USB and TV out easy to hook up and transfer photos  A compactflash slot allows for expandibility of picture capacity  The quality of the photos is about what you would expect for a 1 megapixel camera even though it has 764k pixels  sharp enough to put full size 1024x768 on your screen  but not incredibly sharp when printed out  Forget about enlargements with this one  Photos can be taken in three resolution modes  and with the finest the camera will hold 12 pictures  The middle mode is alright for quick snaps and allows for more than double that amount of pictures  On the bad side  there is a delay of 10 15 seconds between taking pictures which can be annoying if you have to take several in a row  Battery life is short  Very  very short It is not uncommon for me to have to change batteries after only 15 20 pictures  Use of the LCD screen dramatically reduces the battery life  The camera is bulky and heavy  not exactly pocket size  and if you could get it in there it would probably tear right through your pocket  It is quite awkward to hold as well  I can t even count how many times I thought I d taken a great picture  only to find upon further examination that my finger was in the way of the shot  In the end  it all comes down to  You get what you pay for  Don t expect to buy this camera and have a high end digital  because it s not  It s one of the best of the Low end cameras  because many of the other ones almost seem like toys   Jam Cam  and take photos that look like they were beamed from Pluto  If however  you are looking for a Digicam that won t break the bank  and don t care about enlarging and framing your photos  then the Polaroid PDC 700 may be for you  
Camera, I recently purchased the Fuji MX 1200  I bought it for taking general pictures  nothing professional  It is a great camera  perfect for the photography enthusiast or anybody who likes having fun  When I first got the camera  I played with it for about 4 hours  There are lots of nice features   i like the little display pic video on the back  It s a good camera  and it s easy to use  Buy it  Some standard features include  1 3 million pixel CCD   resolution  1280x960 pixels  2x digital zoom 1 6 quot  LCD monitor  built in flash File Format Jpeg exif  with 3 compression levels  1 4 1 8 1 16 Storage Media  SmartMedia  3 3V  2MB to 32 MB   comes w  4MB Focus  70cm 2 3feet to infinity  10cm 4 inches  Macro Output  Serial Power Source  AAx4 or AC Power Adapter  optional br br  
Camera, 9 00 Last December  I received the camera as a gift  I was thrilled at finally getting into the digital revolution  I am now questioning my prior emotions  I am not an avid photographer actually I used to hate taking photos  I was under the impression that a digital camera would be more convenient and less costly  Both of those are true  but the images are not nearly as clear as a 35mm camera To make things simple I would like to outline the benefits of the Agfa digital camera versus a standard 33mm camera Pros 1  Get to view the images instantly with the digital camera 2  Can delete images that you do not like  and don t have to pay for developing 3  For people who like toys  it is just that 4  Very easy to upload images to a computer  then on to an email or printer Cons 1  Printing a digital image is just as costly as 33mm 2  Memory packs run out of space quickly  unless you take poor resolution photos 3  No zoom  The camera lets you crop an image and then increase the size  but that is not the same as a zoom 4  The initial cost of the camera is much more expensive than a standard 33mm Assuming the choice is not between digital and 33mm here are the pros and cons of the Agfa digital camera versus other digital cameras Pros 1  Uses standard AA batteries  A 4 pack of AA from Radio shack with a charger costs about  20 2  Easy to use  The controls are simple 3  USB port makes it very easy to upload images to a computer  The S Video makes it simple to view images on a tv 4  Low cost   About  250 Cons 1  Poor image quality I hope I have helped with your decision br br  
Camera, I have had 2 other brand digital cameras and this is the only one that worked for over a month  I am an online auction seller and take a number of pictures nearly every day  I have had this camera for nearly a year and it still works like a charm First of all  after loading the batteries and memory card you simply push the spring loaded power switch and the camera is almost instantly ready to take a photo  You may then turn the dial on the right hand side of the camera to the play icon to review the photos that you have taken or to the trashcan icon to delete any unwanted photos Secondly  after installing and configuring the software you may download the photos to your computer by simply attaching the serial cable to the computer and camera and switching the turn dial to the computer icon and clicking a few buttons on your computer  This process is however very slow  It takes around 5 20 minuets to download the pictures to the computer depending on picture quality and amount The camera takes excellent close up macro photos when configured properly  In this mode you may get the camera as close as 3 inches from the subject to take a photo  You may find that when in the macro mode the camera will display a camera shaking notice  you must set the camera to forced flash in order to get rid of this message and take focused and properly rendered close up photos  The bundled software is not exactly one of the cameras better features  It has an old not very user friendly interface  I would personally recommend that you use Adobe Photo deluxe or a similar software package to edit your pictures Finally  the Fuji MX 1200 is a great deal for the money  It is excellent to put in a purse or pocket for quick snapshots on the fly  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone as a first time camera or for a teenager br br  
Auto, Bought this car used in 1995 and have put on about 100 000 miles of mixed highway  city driving Performance  Very good Acceleration is sprightly and smooth  Because of the small displacement 2 5L V6  low end torque is only decent  Handling is good on the stock wheels but as I lucked into some almost new Ronal mags for  125us  the increased offset of the wheels improves handling markedly  The wider track definitely improved cornering capability and decreased body roll Reliability  Average Had some brake problems but they were the fault of the brake shop  Speedy Muffler and Brake  Discs warped 3 successive times after new pads and disc grind  New pads installed by another shop have been fine  Still on original discs after 100 000 miles  Same for clutch and exhaust system  Recently replaced igniter  serpentine belt  Some valve chatter in the mornings  warranty service fixed this twice but problem has returned  Not a big deal unless the chatter continues after driving  meaning the valves aren t sealing  Haven t had any trouble with electrical systems  Parts are quite expensive compared to other Japanese makers Exterior  Average Fit and finish is typical Mazda  Better than American but not as good as Toyota and Honda  Paint is also typical Mazda  thin  
Camera, I am not quite sold on the whole digital camera thing  but there is so much talk about it  I had to find just the right inexpensive model and give it a try Now keep in mind  I take about 2 3 rolls of film a week with a very nice SLR camera that does a lot  And I wanted a digital camera about the same for a hundred bucks  giggle  but this is close The price is right The software is cool  and I am starting to get the hang of it Downloading pictures to the computer is kind of confusing  but I am still trying Pictures are very easy to make  I love the 1 8  color LED display monitor  it could be better  but beggars can t be choosers So far I think this is a great camera for the person who is inquisitive about digital cameras  but if you want a good camera  pay a little more and shop a little more  
Camera, I love this camera  I used  and have kept  my trusty Olympus D450Z for almost 2 years  and became hooked on a digital camera  The D450Z was great except   the 1 3megapixel ccd did limit me to at most 5x7 prints  it used a slow serial port transfer  the 3x optical zoom was just not sufficient for too many pictures I wanted to take The C700UZ with its 2 1megapixels  USB  and 10x zoom has solved all these issues  I am not by any means a professional photographer  and to get professional reviews  I suggest going to  http www imaging resource com  http www steves digicams com  http www dpreview com http www cnet com I will provide here a general user s review  My main interests in picture taking have been of family pictures  indoor and outdoor  my kids  sports  soccer and basketball  and vacation and scenery  Family pictures work well  and the flash unit is quite acceptable  Sports pictures have worked very well for outdoor events  I have discovered that you need to take MANY sports action pictures to get one decent one  Using a digital camera I can as many pictures as I want and only keep the good ones  of course  The camera has an action setting  and the 10x zoom has been invaluable for getting some incredible soccer pictures  I do recommend  however  that you use a tripod to help steady the camera   The Olympus 2100UZ does come with an image stabilization feature  but the camera is significantly larger  For my uses  I wanted the smaller size  Trying to take indoor basketball pictures has not been very successful  but it may have to do with the poor lighting in the gyms  Scenery pictures have also been excellent  but I have occasionally encountered what is called chromatic aberration  In high contrast areas of a picture  for example  a bright sky behind the dark leaves of a tree  the pictures appear with a purplish tinge around them  It isn t particularly glaring or problematic  but it happens frequently enough on that really great picture that you will want to try to tone it down  It can easily be done with the high end photo editing software  eg  Photoshop  but the cheapest  free  and easiest way to do it is with Serif s PhotoPlus 5 0  This free download  http www serif com downloads asp  allows you to select a tonal range across an entire picture and then reduce its contrast   I have not found any other mid  to low end product that can do this  PhotoDeluxe  PictureIt  PhotoDraw  Image Composer  PhotoImpact  SmartPhoto  Other scattered observations  The camera comes with an 8Mb SmartMedia card  You will find heated discussions about the superiority of one of the media formats SmartMedia  CompactFlash  Memory Stick  etc but I have been very pleased with SmartMedia  It is small  and it is now also cheap   I have purchased a 64Mb card for  35  Some people prefer to have a high Mb card  but I have gone with cards in the 16  32  or 64 range both because they are cheaper and because I won t lose everything if I should happen to lose one card  I have also purchased a MicroTek CameraMate USB SmartMedia CF reader  I use it to download images from the card without always having to use the camera  which does come with a USB transfer cable  I can also use this device and the SM cards as portable storage devices for any file type  The camera comes with a new lithium ion battery pack  but you will quickly want to get NiMH rechargeable batteries  Battery life in general is quite good  I can take about 150 shots or so  viewing  deleting  etc on one set of charged batteries  I like the clamshell design on my old D450Z  The C700UZ is larger  but it is still unbelievably compact for a 10x optical zoom  Many of the older Olympus models had a lens capped that dropped off when the camera was turned on  but the C700UZ lens cap now has a retainer cord  Once you have a 10x optical zoom  it is hard to go to anything else   I never even bother with the digital zoom  You can enlarge pictures later on the computer  The camera comes with an NTSC A V cable so you can plug the camera into a TV or VCR and view your pictures onscreen  It s a great way to share pictures  Note that many other cameras do not have this feature  The included Camedia software is fine  but I find that I mostly use the built in preview feature of Windows Explorer on my WinME system  You will want another photoediting program to do any significant editing  The 1 5  TFT LCD works quite well  even in bright outdoor light  You can even shoot up to 15 second movies with this camera  They aren t the greatest quality  but it is a nice extra feature  The viewfinder is not a through the lens type but is  as I understand it  actually a mini LCD panel  The advantage to it is that your picture comes out just as you see it  The disadvantage is that there is some loss of detail  and it can be a bit dim  It works well enough  The camera can be used pretty much as a point and shoot if you want using the AUTO setting  You do have other automatic settings  landscapes  portraits  action  and if you want  you can take full control of all settings  I find that the automatic settings are useful for most purposes  but I do some manual settings when I want to do macro mode  play around with flash effects  when I want to set white balance settings under different lighting situations  eg  flourescent  or adjust ISO settings  The camera has an amazing ISO 800 equivalency which is great for low light shots  It is possible to buy a CLA 4 adaptor and add lens  filters  etc to this camera  I have settled on using the HighQuality JPEG setting  Each picture uses about 450k or so  The quality is excellent for producing up to 8x10  prints  I keep all my pictures on my computer and burn to CD  I print some of the pictures on my inkjet  For pictures I want as prints  I upload to sites like Ofoto or ClubPhoto  I recently have begun using Walmart s services and have been satisfied  To really get all the potential out of this camera  which I am not doing  you need to read the manual  There is a brief starter manual printed  but you really have to read the full manual which only comes on the included CD  The camera feels well balanced and well made and has been quite durable and sturdy  I waited until BestBuy had one of their 10  off anything 3 day sales to get my camera at a price comparable to the best online price available  
Auto, I must admit  I haven t driven this car before but we own one and I m in it quite alot  I think that this is a great van  I m the type of person that likes alot of room in the backseat and to feel really comfortable  and this van sure offers that  Good sound quility throughout the van for everybody to enjoy the music being played  A C vents in the back so all the passangers can get their fair share of the air conditioner  You can comfortably sit about 6 people in the van not including the driver  P  Also  when your on the road  you hardly feel the car moving at all  it is just one quit ride to wherever you re going  I went on a road trip for about 12 hours in this van  and there was not one problem that occured with it  What I m tryin to say is the Plymouth Voyager is a really reliable car and it wouldn t let you down br br  
Camera, I purchased my MVC FD71 about a year and a half ago  and have taken over 1 000 snapshots with it  One of the nicest features of the Mavica line is the fact that shots are put onto standard 1 44MB floppy disks  It s not very difficult to carry a number of these around with you  and since you can delete pictures and reuse the disks  you can end up with unlimited shots  If you have trouble taking good photos  having unlimited tries to get one shot right helps  The LCD screen lets you preview your work  so you don t have to be tied to your PC to see if you got the shot  and you never have to go through waiting for film to be developed to find out your shots were no good ever again There are a few things that can be improved with this particular camera model  however  It has a 10X zoom  but it would be nice to be able to use interchangeable lenses to get more range when you need it  The lithium battery that comes with it lasts quite a while  but you can t take any shots while it is recharging unless you sink 50 to 100 bucks on a spare  The resolution on the camera can be set to a few different levels  but the highest res picture available is a 640 x 480 bitmap  which takes up an entire floppy  Many other cameras boast 800 x 600 pictures as a minimal setting  with even higher resolutions available  and have memory cards that allow many more pictures to be taken Overall  the Mavica does the job for me  I can take shots of anything I want  and if I take my time  I can take shots that rival what I d take with a normal camera  Combine the Mavica with a good quality printer  and you may never need to take film photographs again  Any and all photos you see on my website  once I put the site back up  were taken with my Mavica  including the pic of me on my profile here on Epinions If you have a high end computer with USB ports or a port made for the memory cards from other cameras  or if you need to take super high quality photographs  you may want to look elsewhere  As for me  I m happy with my purchase br br  
Auto,  My Saab b 1982 Saab 900S Number of Doors  2 door Transmission  5 speed manual Engine  fuel injected  4 cylinder  2 0 liter  110 horsepower  SOHC Extras  Sunroof  Air conditioning b How I Got My First and Only Saab  During my junior year of college I commuted in a 1982 Oldsmobile Omega  This was not a good car  The 1982 Omega featured the infamous Chevy built 2 8 liter V 6  probably  the worst engine ever   as it s often sited  I bought this car from one of my father s coworkers  But this car was very well taken care of  Not a speck of rust was to be found  the interior looked as if no human had graced its presence  all maintenance records were in order and detailed  This car was supposed to last me until I landed my first job  and then some  But it didn t  Granted  the car ran flawlessly for the first six months I owned it  but then it began to turn against me  The radiator went ka boom in the middle of Boston  the air conditioner was so powerful it turned the car off  if I was going up a hill  in winter  I had to turn off the radio  heater  and rear window defroster to have enough power to climb the hill  It was an under whelming car The car soon began to die a quick death and that s when I was on the lookout for another car  Again  another of my father s coworkers decided to assist me in my quest for reliable transportation  Ha  Anyway  this friend had another friend who had a Saab for sale  And for the sake of story  let s just say that this friend of a friend was shifty The Saab was kept at this friend of a friend s work  a Sunoco station where he was a mechanic  He showed me to the car  It was covered in  clever  bumper stickers and there appeared to be a young tree growing through the engine bay  But I was hopeful  sanguine  I took the key from his meaty hands and turned the ignition  The car grumbled to life right away  I shifted into first gear and drove around the gas station  a very thorough test drive We told him we would take it  The cost was  900 The mechanic who owned the Saab said he just had to find the title at his house and that he would pass it along to my father s friend who in turn would pass it along to my father who would hopefully pass it along to me One month later I received the title  It was a little suspicious  The name signed on the back was not the mechanic s name  but a woman s name  And then there was the date  The date was off by 10 months  dated 10 months earlier  What happened  Was there some sort of shift in the space time continuum that I was not aware of I brought the title over to my insurance agent and she looked the title over and said   Well  the Registry probably won t even notice  in fact  if they do  they will just assume she s old Okay b The Bad Saab Mechanic in Newburyport  MA  He was a bad man  a real bad man  Here s my little story  My car wouldn t start  or more accurately  it started but intermittently  As my spider sense tingled I determined that this was a problem  So  I drove down to my trusty local mechanic and relayed to him the problem at hand A few hours later I received a phone call from the very same mechanic  my mechanic  He stated that he didn t really know what was wrong with the car  He confessed to me  although I am not a priest and he is not Catholic but Muslim  that he didn t work much on Saabs but that he had the name of a very good Saab mechanic As soon as he revealed to me the name of this Saab Master Mechanic I called and told this Swedish automotive sage my story  After concluding the phone call I was on my way to Newburyport  almost 13 miles from my house Two days later the Saab Master Mechanic called my home to tell me the car was ready  After much excitement and washing of hands  I asked my father for a ride to the garage to collect my car  Little did I know what was in store We arrived at the garage a short time later and the Saab Master Mechanic greeted us warmly  He grabbed the keys to my car and showed me what I had hoped for  the car started  right away  the first try  Victory was mine Then the bill came What the problem was with the bill was not the price  it was actually low  especially for a Saab  but there was an extra item added into the grand total that called my attention  a towing charge b A Very Short Play  ME What s this towing charge  I drove the car here SAAB MASTER MECHANIC Well  I often drive home the cars I m working on  and your car died in my driveway  and I had to have it towed ME You re charging me for your tow SAAB MASTER MECHANIC Yup ME But I told you the car was having trouble starting  Why would you drive it home SAAB MASTER MECHANIC It s how I work ME But that doesn t seem fair SAAB MASTER MECHANIC Alright  you don t have to pay the towing charge  and if you don t  you can never bring the car back here again At this point my father interrupted and said   Okay  fine  here  and paid for my towing charge  I never went back to the Saab Master Mechanic  On the way home I stopped by my regular mechanic and I told him   Look  I don t care if you have to work from a book  I m not going back to that Saab guy  I then told my mechanic what had happened at the Saab guy  My mechanic apologized for the unpleasantness I experienced and said he would do his best with my Saab  What a guy  And boy  did he make some major mistakes b Radiator  Starter  Alternator  Battery  Fuel Pump  and Breaks  Unknown to me at the time  my newly purchased Saab had been dormant for quite some time  Dormancy is just about the worst one can do to a car  Parts  major and expensive parts  corrode and deteriorate  I drove my Saab for approximately one month before it turned against me  several times First  the radiator went  No problem  I got a used one off dad s co worker and dad installed it  Thanks daddy  The starter was next  which was misdiagnosed by my mechanic  and I ended up with a new alternator  Then the starter was replaced  but this was undermined by the fact that the battery was now dead  Off to the Sears Auto Center I go  Die Hards  please  Now the car could produce and use electricity  Another attack on my bank account quickly followed as a faulty fuel pump  the one in the gas tank Saabs have two fuel pumps  choked my car into submission and left me stranded at work on a cold New England winter night  Daddy b Final Tips and Good Things about Saabs  50 50 reliability  Saabs either last forever or fall apart  That s just the way it is  Of course  people of higher incomes will have a much better time with their Saabs since they can afford the high maintenance bills If you re buying used  make sure that the car was well maintained  Of course  this goes for any car  but with Saabs it s especially true Saabs don t rust easily You too can often put high mileage on a Saab  I ve seen Saabs with well over 300 000 miles on their odometers  and they weren t even being being towed Join a Saab club and learn to do some repairs on your own  You can get factory parts for cheap  real cheap  This will save you money  lots of money Comfy seats  It s like driving around in your living room  if your living room is very small and encased in sheet metal The engine doesn t leak  Despite the fact that my car had all these aforementioned mechanical problems  the engine itself was always reliable and never leaked Spacious engine bay for you to work in  if you like doing that sort of thing  I tried to install spark plugs once and didn t tag the spark plug wires and reinstalled them into the wrong positions  That was a rough start Dipsticks for everything  even manual transmission fluid  large funnel like caps  so it s easy to add fluids b Postscript  I taught my girlfriend at the time how to drive stick in this dear old Saab of mine  We went to school together  and after the spring semester was over  she went home to Maine  I drove my Saab up to Maine every other weekend to see her Halfway through the summer  I received a  letter  from her and it was not  good news  She announced that she had gotten a new haircut and was now a new woman  and I was history  Yup The Saab soon bankrupted me  new breaks   700  and I had to sell it  My parents had been assisting me financially for the upkeep of this car  but I felt bad that it was costing so much money  I sold the Saab to another of my father s coworkers for  500  He belonged to a Saab Club and he got the car running fine and dandy  He discovered that the fuel pump in the engine needed to be replaced  Cost   25 Damn it  
Camera, This is truly a must for families apart  The versatility of this camera is awesome  You can snap studio quality photos in an instant and minutes later e mail them to family members  The camera can instantly be set to movie mode an you may shoot a 60 second mpeg that can easily be attached to an email an sent from coast to coast The camera is very easy to set up and record to a mini disc  This disc will fit in any modern  post 1993  computer and transfer the image to your P C  There is also software that accompanies the camera that allows transfer via USB port  The software also offers photo editing which includes printing aspects  The setup of the camera is very user friendly and can be accomplished by any novice computer user  The features on the camera are endless and can intrigue the most extensive camera buff The downside of the camera is the price tag  The camera I got cost  995 00 from www ecost com  This may seem a little exuberant but you truly get what you pay for in a digital camera  You may find digital cameras from other manufacturers for cheaper but the cost of memory stick and add ons will cost you more in the long run I cannot recommend this camera enough and once you overcome the price I am sure you will be happy  
Camera, Just got this today at Office Max for  149 99 with a free 32mb memory card and Dazzle memory card reader  Definitely a fantastic deal  but just the camera along is awesome  It takes great pictures  with beautiful quality and resolution  It will do a 60 second video with audio  The quality is poor on the video  but after all this is a camera and not a camcorder  It has a different functions to keep you busy  but once you get them down it s a breeze  Many people who aren t comfortable with gizmos and technology  might find it a little daunting  It isn t a point and shoot camera  you have to fine tune it a little  but the results are worth it  If this is your first DC then you will be happy and would even make a great travel camera  The only two issues I have with it are  it eats batteries  get 1800Mah NiMH rechargables for it  and the time between shots  otherwise it is a great camera  
Auto, It was always my dream to own a hummer  I wanted it so bad ever since i was a kid  and recently I finally got one  It s difficult to own and maintenance  but is well worth it Features Pros Huge tires  These tires are bigger than my 7 year old son  They are huge and well worth it  Even though a set ends up costing over  500  its well worth it  When i took this beast up to the mountains  I was amazed at the stuff it could do  It was driving over 5 foot rocks like there was nothing there  This thing was driving through 4 feet of water with ease like it would on the road  It is definately a vehicle for the offroad  No wonder they use them in the army  Tough  You can t imagine how tough these things are  I smacked into a tree head on at 70 mph and there was barely a scratch on it  I mean just imagine if that was a car  Sure the other people wouldn t be lucky to hit you  but you are almost garunteed survival  With the hge tires  you d probably end up running them over like that 5 foot rock  It s just about the safest little beast you can ride  It s very intimidating to see this monterous beast driving up to you with its huge form  It has a the same width of an 18 wheeler and almost as tall  Nobody ll get in your way with this thing Fame  Whenever I go anywhere with my hummer  even just a small trip to the grocery store  there is almost always somebody there to ask about my hummer  It ll make you feel like you re a star  when somebody comes up and asks questions and says that they wish they had a hummer  If you don t like being popular  don tget a hummer  But who wouldn t love the envy of others  Surprisingly quiet  I once rode in a 1992 hummer at my uncles house as a child  and I remembered the huge car  huge tires  and huge sound  It was like driving one of those old submarines where you go deaf after two hours  The radio had to be up all the way just to hear it  But now  somehow they kept that same ominous look and feel  without that apocalyptic sound  You can take a nice quiet drive down the road at night without waking up the whole neigborhood  2 000 pund winch  There is an option to get a 2 000 pound winch and i would suggest getting it  Now you can put your hummer to work  Drag entire trees into your campsite and other things on that subject  I once tried to use my hummer for water skiiing in a small lake  I don t suggest this  But still  it s great to have it  You can do alkmost anything with the hummer if you get this Cons Gas Guzzler  As much as I wanted a hummer as a child  I did research and found out what it was really like  It gets horriblegas mileage and uses hard to find deisel  They give you a huge tank for a reason  You can hold about 45 gallons in the Primary and Auxillary tanks  so it is well eqipped to last about 500 1000 miles  It s much better on the highway because you can control the road with the fear of others and you don t have to slow down often  And in the woods its a powerhouse  but I would neer use my hummer to commute  I made a pact with myself never to own a regualar car  so I drive a Saturn VUE most places  It gets good gas mileage  but that s off the subject  Don t get the hummer as your primary vehicle  because you ll be spending hundreds on gas  Every week or so  I do take my hummer to work just to show it off  but it s just not healthy to take it every day Sluggish steering  I found it to have some slow steering to no surprise  I have gotten used to it but in the beginning  I couldn t take it anywhere  It really is a bit difficult to go most places until you get used to the way it works and it is not fun when you re waiting  But it is well worth it because once you get used to it  It s a huge  mean  fighting machine Space  It takes up a lot of space  I can t fit it in my garage  but it doesn t get dirty in the rain  And you can t park it at those parking garges with height limits most of the time  and sometimes you have to hang out of the wondow to pick up your food at the drive through  but the size pays off  If you re going to meet someone  they can t miss a huge green hummer  And it strikes fear on the hearts of millions  but the size does limit it places to go  Another reason I prefer my VUE  
Camera, I had been wanting a digital camera  researching all the sites  reading reviews  and had decided on the Casio Exilim series  The old Advantix died in May  so  my camera purchase was forced  I ordered the Exilim Z3 from CDW in May 2003  but  after waiting 4 weeks with no known due date  I cancelled the order  I started looking elsewhere and couldn t find this camera anywhere  I contacted Casio for help  They told me to try Radio Shack  I couldn t image they would have such a high tech toy as I hadn t been in a Radio Shack for years  Was I shocked  I took my boss with me  of who was also going to buy one  Our local Radio Shack had one  so  he called around  There was no Radio Shack within a 3 hour radius that had one  they were all sold out  Radio Shack had a promotion with which I received a free carrying case  static LCD screen protectors and a cleaning kit  This seems to be a hot item to say the least This camera is great  It has a best shot feature that sets the exposure  white balance  focus  etc  for you based on what you are taking photos of  This best shot feature shows you a sample picture of these settings and describes what the setting does  There are 21 preset settings and you have the option to make your own  I use Sunset  Portrait  and Portrait with Scenery most often  It is really easy to use  It will also allow you to set these items yourself  which I m sure the pros would love  Another interesting setting is the White Balance  On auto  the camera compensates well  however  I have found the under fluorescent lighting  you need to set White Balance to fluorescent  There are six settings  Auto  full sun  shade  incandescent  fluorescent  and manual The camera also allows you to take 30 second live video with sound  The sound is pretty good as long as there is no wind to ruffle the sound  The video is better than video I have seen on a lot of cameras The camera has 3X optical zoom and 9X digital zoom  giving you a total of 12X zoom  I have Windows XP on my computer  so  when I hooked the base up to my USB port  XP immediately recognized it  installed the drivers and asked me what I wanted to do  You can browse the file system on the camera as it is docked just like it was another hard drive  I didn t need to install any software and transferring the pictures is as simple as copying and pasting I contacted support once more to be sure there were no issues with the 128MB SD memory card  I contacted them via e mail and I had an answer in two hours  You get a  real  person at customer service  you get their  personal  e mail address  and they are really friendly With the 128MB SD memory card I can take the following 31   30 second videos 68   2048X1536 FINE pictures 105   1600X1200 FINE pictures 163   1280X960 FINE pictures 584   640X480 FINE pictures 767   640X480 NORMAL pictures 1227   640X480 ECONOMY pictures Each quality setting allows for any resolution  I just didn t list all of them here I have yet to run the battery dead  after a week at the beach and around 300 pictures videos  so  I m not sure of the available battery time The time between shots is around 2 seconds and the time between actually pushing the record button and getting the picture can sometimes lag around a second  It really seems to depend on the situation  which I assume is related to auto focus  However  this is still much better than our Advantix was so  no complaints here on that subject There are several features that we still haven t played with and after downloading the PDF for full documentation  we still haven t read through all 100  pages Two features we find to be the coolest are  on screen cropping of photos  and the 3X timer feature  The on screen cropping feature will allow you to center shots  The 3X timer feature will take the first photo after 10 seconds  the second photo after 1 second  and then the last photo after another 1 second  This proved very good for the latest family picture of 38 people  the last picture being the best The red eye reduction feature is also interesting in that upon snapping the picture the camera flashes several times  So  if the cool camera wasn t drawing enough attention the flash sure will  The most common comments   147What was that 148   147Can I see it 148   147How does that zoom work 148  
Camera, Don t get me wrong  the Canon Elph S200 is an awesome camera  it s super compact  it takes great photos  clear up to an 8x10  it s simple to use  it takes decent MPEGs  and it looks way cool This is the perfect camera for anyone taking simple snapshots of friends and family  I bought this before my first child was born so that I had a digital camera during labor and delivery and could send out those first pictures of the baby over the internet with a quickness  It worked out great  The pictures were very clear  even in low light  I m not sure why there are complaints on the flash quality  we had absolutely no problems in that area  Even when I couldn t see the baby on the LCD screen because the room was too dark  the flash was definitely bright enough to take a great picture I also love that it uses the Compact Flash card rather than a Smart card  Since more and more things are using a Flash card rather than the Smart Media  I am able to swap my IPAQ s card with my Elph s and always have a spare The battery life has also not been an issue for us  As you can imagine  being new parents we take tons of pictures  I typically take about ten pictures a day and maybe three movies a week  I do not charge my battery more than once a week  if that  So  in other words  the battery lasts for quite some time  I also love the fact that the battery is rechargeable  and it does quickly recharge  about an hour and a half after the first charge  because we would be going through a million batteries otherwise The camera is also sturdy and durable  I take this camera with me every where and it usually travels by diaper bag so it gets thrashed around quite a bit  It also has gotten occasionally  misted  or gotten some baby finger goop on it  but it cleans up like a champ and I have not had one problem with it working improperly or being damaged I have a few complaints about the camera   I wish the zoom was better  I know that the digital zoom can get right up close  but you lose so much resolution when you print that I never go past the 2 0 optical zoom  Usually  that s close enough  But now that my little one is walking  it is hard to get a nice  close up shot when he s across the room  There is lens adapter so no additional lenses can be attached  There is no battery life indicator  This makes it difficult to determine when the battery needs charging  until it gets too late  I wish it came with a carrying case  Canon offers a camera case specifically for the Elph  but from what I can remember  they were a bit pricey  We opted for getting a generic holder  which works great  but it would have been nice if it came with the package when we bought the camera The shutterlag can get a bit annoying  If you always push the shutter halfway down so that the camera has ample time to focus and what not  then the shutter  obviously  won t lag  But if you want to take a quick photo to capture that perfect moment  you may just miss it because the camera took too long to do its business  This is not terribly pronounced  but it does happen  The 16MB compact flash card is a joke  Considering how inexpensive flash cards have become  you would think Canon would spring for a 128 or something  I really do like this camera  it certainly serves its purpose at the moment  Eventually it will be traded in for a camera that accepts additional lenses and  of course  has more megapixels  
Auto, I bought this car for its great looks and reliability  Honestly  I m a  quot Made in America quot  kind of guy  and I started out looking at the domestics  but in the end I chose what I thought to be the better car  my opinion  of course  Besides  there s just something about those sexy quad headlamps Love  This car is just plain fun to drive  pretty impressive acceleration for a 4 cylinder  especially in 3rd gear around 38mph  great handling  very comfortable seats Hate  I don t hate anything about the car  There really isn t much room in the back seat  but if I cared about a back seat  I wouldn t have gotten a sport coupe  One problem I do have is with changing the oil filter  It s difficult to reach unless you access it from underneath  I alternate between changing the oil myself and taking it to the garage where they use a bay  in other words  I only change the filter every other oil change  which is fine Although it s too soon to rave about reliability  car is only 1 year old  Honda has a great track record  so I m expecting great things from this car  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a sporty  reliable  great looking car  I would probably NOT recommend this car to anyone over 6 2 quot  I am not quite 6 2 quot  and I keep my front seat all the way back and slightly declined  It s comfortable for me to drive this way  but for any taller drivers who prefer to sit closer to the wheel  this might not be your car  One last note  On the Edmund s website I read several posts where drivers complained of the road noise from inside the car  I ve never had any problem with road noise  even on several different types of roads Happy driving br br  
Auto, I just brought a Sante Fe about 6 months ago and I am impressed by a lot of features about it  1  A very smooth and quiet ride  The suspension system is great and the noise level from outside is very low while you are driving  when the windows are up  It handles the road very well  It gets through the snow well but don t expect it to handle like the bigger utility vehicles  It can handle a little more snow than the average car  It does have a 4 wheel drive system 2  Very Roomy  You can fold down back seats and have plenty of storage space in the trunk  It sits about 5 people comfortably  Plenty of cup holders for the drive in or long trips 3  A Nice Sound System  The CD player  radio and speaker system are great  Good quality sound 4 Good price and a great warranty  It prices below  20 000 and came with a 100 000 mile warranty 5  Good looking body style will get you noticed on the road  It also has luggage carrying straps on top of vehicle  It is about average on gas consumption All in all a great deal for the bargain conscious consumer in my opinion  
Camera, Many users like floppies because they re familiar and offer a cable free PC interface  which is uncommon in digital cameras  But floppy disks provide limited storage space and require an unacceptably long delay while an image is saved  Although the Mavica MVC FD90 writes images to floppies four times faster than PC floppy drives  it still makes you wait 10 seconds between shots  You might capture your child s first step  but you ll miss the second and third ones  You have to wait about 6 seconds for the camera to power on before you can take a shot One of the camera s biggest advantages is long battery life  and the LCD displays the minutes of charge time remaining  But you can t change the batteries while the Mavica MVC FD90 is mounted on a tripod  That s unfortunate because the camera is unwieldy and hard to position handheld for image composition with the LCD  even though the screen is large and bright  The camera s user interface is a little confusing at first  but once you ve run through the features a few times  the clearly marked controls and menus make it easy to operate br br  
Camera, I can characterize myself as a buyer that adapts to the tool s shortcomings rather than one that makes the ideal purchase no matter the price  However  in this case this camera has exceeded my demands  My original reason for purchasing this model was the desire for a digital camera with a higher megapixel count and that was affordable relatively speaking and this model has been discounted heavily with the introduction of the sony f717 b  Pros   Lets begin with the unique body design  I tend to enjoy going to local events because with the current mob mentality in Los Angeles one never knows when a riot is about to breakout  Anyways being a person of medium stature this design is great for getting a well focused overhead shot  I end up turning the camera upside down so that I can view the LCD screen and the other hand is free to operate the zoom lens button on the lens no having to fumble around on the camera body for the zoom lens feature  Also for low angle shots this camera proves ideal I don t try many because in Los Angeles this prone position is a candidate for an appearance on America s Most Wanted  Not to mention that the automatic focusing is extremely fast so that one can get that live action shot of the mugger or muggee Since getting this camera I ve reverted back to actually shooting more in shutter priority mode  With most lesser brands of digital cameras the settings were either very limited  nikon 880  or the fact that you had to perform numerous adjustments to get the proper exposure  With the sony this feature is done with a easily reachable knob near the shutter release that also control aperture settings  Why you ask would anyone care for the fact that capturing action shots I wanted that freeze frame look and didn t always trust the camera settings  Besides with the large f2 0 aperture this allows more choices than the typical other slower lenses found on lesser priced cameras  I like the fact that features such as the zoom lens capability  white balance exposure  AE lock are placed on the zoom instead of the camera body due to the fact that I don t have to stop concentrating on the subject and bring down the camera to toggle a button or possibly jam another finger between my head and camera body to make an adjustment    Cons   I do have issue with the electronic view finder because after the shutter is depressed it doesn t follow the action but then the cameras buffer doesn t allow rapid single shots  but there is a continuous setting  Everybody complains about the proprietary accessories  but there is a growing aftermarket of fairly priced accessories that work as well as the sony brand b  Recommendation   If you are a photo enthusiast looking for a unique camera that has the following strengths  ability to handle every angle of coverage  large aperture setting  f2 0  for lowlight and action shots  major controls placed on the lens barrel zoom  white balance  ae lock  allowing one to better focus on the subject consider this camera As to whether the sony f717 is worth spending the extra money on unless one needs the higher ISO  or faster shutter speed  or the hotshoe mount which are cosmetic and not revolutionary when compared to the f707  
Camera, Got this camera about 3months ago  I paid about  220 for a refurb  for the price it is hard to beat  But the camera has quite a few drawbacks 1  the picture quality is good  but still rather grainy  I can t say if it prints well or not 2  Only 2x zoom  for the size of camera it is not much 3  Battery door seems to be a little flimsy and is difficult 4  The navigation button is a pain   Pls just use up down  left right and enter buttons  no reason for rocker 5  BIG Problem  it takes about 3sec after you press the button to take the picture  if you use red eye  it takes about 3 seconds to first flash and then about 2 seconds to red eye flash Pros 1  128MB SmartMedia support  over 120 pics at highest picture level  over 240 at 2nd highest 2  USB connection is fast and easy  Win 2000 3  LCD is clear  great for previewing pictures 4  Menu system is good If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive megapixel camera and don t require a great zoom  this is definitely one to look at  but buy the AC adapter also  If you want or require good zoom  high quality pictures  and quick snapshots look elsewhere Mark 
Camera, If you read my S200 review  you know how I got the S330 camera  My brother got a good deal on this camera at Dell com with 10  off and a stackable  25 off  250 coupon  The final price came out to  324 with free shipping and no sales tax  The camera s MRSP is  499 but you will find it on store shelves and web sites for  399 and under b The Short Take  The S330 is the 2002 update to the PowerShot S300 camera that was fairly popular  although I believe it was not as popular as the S110 last year  The S300 was a solid performer that offered more user features than the more basic S110  The S330 improves the camera here and there and adds a few new twists to the design and function  For the most part  the S330 seems to be a tweaked version of the S300 model The similarities of the S330 to S300 start with both being 2 MegaPixel camera with 3x optical zoom and 2 5x digital zoom  The basic camera size is about the same but still slightly larger than the S110 S200 Digital ELPH  The S330 retains all the features of the S300 with alot of tweaking done by Canon  Just a few new features make its appearance on the S330 just like on the S200  Also debuting is the enhanced Lithium Ion battery for the S330 S200 models  the NB 1LH battery The main perceived weaknesses of this camera are the short battery life despite the improved battery  2 MegaPixel capacity  and a perceivable size difference from the S110 S200 model  Despite having just slightly larger numbers in dimensions and weight  the S330 feels like a much different and heavier beast than the light and tiny S110 despite what the numbers say Again  the main competition here seems to be Canon PowerShot S200 and Minolta DimageX  However  because of the larger camera size  other competitors include the Nikon CoolPix 2500  775  885  Canon S30  S40  several Olympus and Fuji models as well  The S300 is smaller than most of the camera listed above with the exceptions of the S200  the DimageX  and perhaps the CoolPix 2500 Overall  the S330 is a worthy successor to the S300 but doesn t warrant an upgrade from the S300  It is a solid take anywhere camera that provides a bit more manual controls if you so desire it b i Pros i b 1  Fairly Compact Size 2  2 MegaPixel Camera 3  3x Optical Zoom 4  CompactFlash Media 5  Movie Record  limited 6  Multiple On Camera Photo Effects 7  Direct Printing to Specific Canon Printers like 820D  DPOF   Digital Print Order Format 8  AiAF system  Artificial Intelligence AutoFocus 9  Adjustable ISO settings 10  Self Timer 11  Stainless Steel Case 12  Accepts batteries from S110 S300 model ELPH b i Cons b i 1  Size difference looks and feels substantial to S110 S200 camera 2  Only 2 MegaPixel Camera 3  Short Battery Life despite enhanced Lithium Ion Batteries 4  Expensive Batteries 5  Weak Flash 6  Edge mount for tripods b Detail Time  If you ve seen the S200  then there isn t alot of difference between the two in overall styling  The S330 has a couple more buttons and an external speaker as well  The S330 is similarly styled like the S300 The S330 s dimensions are 3 7 x 2 5 x 1 3 inches with a weight of 9 7 oz  with CompactFlash card and battery installed  Compared to the S200 s dimensions 3 4 x 2 2 x 1 1 inches and weight of 6 6 oz  before CF card and battery  7 7 oz  with CF card and battery  it seems like a scant 0 2 inches in each dimension and a slight weight difference of 2 oz  Well  that s a 25  difference in weight and the slight difference in dimensions adds up to a camera that looks and feels much bigger and heavier than the S200 camera  The unit is 0 1 inches thicker but a tad lighter than the S300 unit  Those of you who are interested in portability should line the S200 and S330 next to each other at the store  the difference is extremely noticable Like the S200  the body is made out of a high impact polycarbonate casing with a stainless steel plating  This change in body design may one of the reasons the S330 is significantly cheaper than the S300 model  A 1 5 inch color LCD with anti reflective coating graces the back of the camera with the same 8 large button layout as the S200  All buttons are easy to press and the user interface is also much easier to use  The S330 retains the retracting lens that slows up turning on and off the camera  The lens is automatically covered when the lens is fully retracted The 1 5 inch 1 18 MegaPixel color LCD that has existed since the first Digital ELPH was released still displays your photos in fine detail and color  it is fairly easily seen in bright sunlight  and it displays even more information that the previous Digital ELPH models before it  Information such as ISO settings  file size compression settings  flash settings  your shooting mode  metering  resolution type  macros  and even a histogram for tonal distribution  which I really don t know what to do with yet  but I ll learn it soon enough  Photos taken using the LCD screen are just about the photos you are recording to file  95  accuracy  since the optical viewfinder is less accurate  85  by some reviews  I find that the LCD shows most of the picture you are taking versus the optical viewfinder b It s all about the pictures  The S330 does a commendable job taking shots for 4x6  5x7  and even gives acceptable 8x10 photos  My Canon PowerShot S40 gave equivalent photos at the 4x6 and 5x7 size  Enlarging the shots beyond the 5x7 size is where most 3 and 4 MegaPixel camera show their superiority  Under the best of conditions  8x10 photos are rather decent with some loss of detail and slight pixelation which is more than you can say for some 2 MegaPixel cameras and even some 3 MegaPixel cameras   My experience has been with mostly Canons  Nikons  and a few Olympus cameras  The 3x optical zoom is great since the digital zoom is fairly unreliable  as it is for most digital cameras  in maintaining picture details Color reproduction has only gotten better in the S330 over the S110 and S300 ELPHs  The S330 shots look a little more natural to me than the S110 S300 models  Details in photos are sharp and the automatic exposure controls do a great job in a wide range of lighting conditions  The AiAF system does a good job in low light conditions although the flash is a bit weak beyond 8 10 feet from the camera  nighttime conditions  The AiAF system works by using three points of reference on the camera to set the focus of the camera  allowing you to take shots with clear and good contrast with little effort on your part   Note that the AiAF system existed in the S300 model as well The S330 performs extremely well as a simple  Point and shoot  camera b The outer look of the S330  In some ways  the camera looks like a larger version of the S200  the S330 keeps to the overall stylings of the Digital ELPH cameras  The camera has a stainless steel exterior that feels extremely smooth for the most part and smudges with fingerprints rather easily  especially the chromed finished areas of the camera  The front face has a slightly raised  ridged area housing the lens  optical viewfinder  and AiAF lamp  The diminutive flash sits at the upper right corner  when looking straight at the camera  The top panel of the camera houses the microphone  shutter  on off button  and dial for shooting mode  The dial could be set from automatic shoot mode  manual shoot mode  stitch assist  movie  and browse mode  The on off button required that you press it down for 1 2 secs to turn on the camera but a single press to shut it off  The right panel of the camera  looking at the back of the camera  houses the cover for the Type I CF slot and the wrist strap attachment  The left panel houses the A V connection and USB connector covered by an attached rubber cover  The bottom panel has the battery cover and the tripod mount which lies at the far left side of the camera  unfortunately The back of the camera houses the 1 5 inch LCD  4 large buttons beneath the LCD which are the Set  Menu  Display  and Exposure Compensation White Balance Photo Effects buttons  A slightly raised circular section to the right of the LCD that acts as a 4 way direction pad for the menus and as secondary buttons for features like spot metering  macro infinity  flash  and continuous self timer mode  There is a thumb rest indentation under the mode dial and right of that is the CF cover latch  The upper left corner of the back of the S330 is the opening for the external speaker and the optical viewfinder to the left of that  The upper right corner has two buttons for zooming in and out  Most of the buttons  except the two leftmost buttons under the LCD  are within reach of your thumb  by the way  I use Medium sized gloves b Battery Life  The overall battery life is a bit better than the S300 although not by much  With the display turned on and all the automatic features enabled  you might get 150 180 shots per fully charged battery  However  if you have the LCD display turned off  you can take nearly 450 shots  Using the older NB 1L battery cuts the numbers down by nearly 30  So you get 100 120 shots with the LCD on and 300 320 shots with the LCD off  Too bad the newer NB 1LH battery runs at least  50 and usually in the  70 80 range  if you can find it b Some Features and File Size Issues  Some new features to the S330 include an orientation sensor so that the camera will automatically rotate the photo into the proper viewing position  support for the CP 10  CP 100  and 820D Canon Photo Printers  the  My Camera  options   long shutter  mode  for low  dim  and nighttime lighting shots  enhanced white balancing selections  option between 2 and 10 second self timer  sound playback on the camera itself  Exposure Flash Exposure AutoFocus Lock modes  spot metering  manual ISO settings from 50 400  and enhanced selection of photo effects directly on camera The  My Camera  mode changes simple things like sounds the camrea makes when being turned on as well as backgrounds for menus  Two default settings are included with room for one more  You can upload sounds and backgrounds through the Zoombrowser software included in the package The continuous shoot mode is actually much faster with the LCD off  With the LCD on you get a slow shot per second rate  but this rate at least doubles with the LCD completely off  The rate with LCD off approaches 3 shots per sec on certain resolutions compared to 1 5 1 8 shots per second with the LCD on  The continuous shoot mode allows the user to take several consecutive photos when holding down the shutter button  You can turn off the AiAF system which gives you a single center AutoFocus point  this does speed up the amount of time it takes to capture photos  The digital zoom can also be turned off as well  The AF assist beam can also be turned off  although I wouldn t recommend it in low night and nighttime shooting  You can also set the long shutter setting in manual shoot mode from 1 to 15 seconds long Resolutions range from Large  1600x1200  Medium  1024x768  and Small  640x480  Compression ranges from Super Fine  largest file setting  Fine  and Normal  smallest file setting  An average Large Super Fine photo takes around 1 MB of memory  This gets a bit larger with more complex pictures Movie mode is quite limited for the S330  You can get 640x480 resolution at 20 frames per second  fps  for a total of 4 secs  320x240 resolution at 20 fps for a total of 10 seconds  and 160x120 resoltuion at 20 fps for a total of 30 seconds  The total file size of the movie cannot exceed 4 MB and is stored only in AVI format  I haven t found the movie mode very useful so far b What s in the package  Canon has always included excellent manuals and documentation for the camera and software included in all their camera packages  The S330 is no different  A good sized camera and software manual is included detailing basic and advanced functions for the camera  A wrist strap is included in the package as well as an updated Lithium Ion battery compared to the S110 S300  The battery has the same size and shape as the NB 1L found in the S110 and S300 cameras but is now dubbed the NB 1LH and carries 840 mAh versus the NB 1L s 680 mAh charge  The same battery charger is also included in the package  You can use the older NB 1L batteries in the S330 but expect a much shorter battery life  You also get a measley 8 MB CF card  so you need to purchase a bigger one  at least 128MB in my opinion  Two CDs are included with the software for the camera  I use Adobe Photoshop 6 right now  so I didn t try the included software I would definitely recommend buying a larger CF card  an additional battery  and a small camera carry case  Remember that you cannot use Type II CF media  like the IBM Microdrive  so your best bet is 128 or 256 MB CF cards  If you really want 1 2 GB and 1 GB CF cards  be forewarned that the price runs in the  400 range for a 512 MB  1 2 GB  CF card and at least  700 for a 1 GB CF card at the time I write this  You should not need more than a 256MB CF card in my opinion  The AC adapter kit might be helpful too although not necessary  but if you plan on printing directly from the camera to the supported Canon printers  I would get the AC adapter  I would highly consider at least a seperate CF reader so you don t have to drain the batteries on the camera transferring images to the computer   You want more details  Check out these additional sites b www imaging resource com www dpreview com Both sides provide detailed looks at the camera that they review and explain features and quality of photos in severe detail  If you can t find the information you re looking for at either of these two sites  I doubt you would find it anywhere b About me and photography and the fate of the camera  I m not a photography student or even an enthusiast  I m a physician that enjoy technology and gadgets  I know the kind of quality and features I want in a camera  although I have several camera lying around the house  These camera include a Canon S40  Nikon CoolPix 5000  Canon S330  Nikon CoolPix 995  I just know that the quality of the pictures of S200 camera are pleasing to my eye and impress friends when I show them the photos taken by the S200 on a computer screen or developed through sites like Ofoto  If you read my S200 review  then you know I first bought that camera  It was taken by my girlfriend and I got back my S110  then my brother traded his S330 for my S110  So now I have the S330 in my possession and now you re reading my review  My girlfriend enjoys the size and flexibility of the S200  My brother enjoys the size and more rugged construction of the S110  yes  I still feel that the S110 is more solidly constructed than the S200 and S330 cameras and it feels heavier than the S200  I like the S330 because it has a 3x optical zoom and a more robust feature set than the S200 camera although the S330 is a bit bulkier than the S200 S110  I guess we all got what we wanted in the end  
Camera, The popularity of the Canon Powershot G2 has had tongues wagging for many months  If only Canon would offer the advanced features and pro level performance of the G2 in a package that was like the super compact S110 and S300  oh  and at a bargain price too  then all would be right in the digital camera world  Well  Canon has done exactly what everyone has been clamoring for  The new Canon Powershot S40 offers almost all the advanced features available on the groundbreaking G2  compact size  almost as small as the Powershot S300  and a bargain price  The S40 is a feature rich four megapixel digital camera that offers advanced amateurs and pro photographers a compact digital imaging machine that provides more features and creative options than most photographers will ever use   A Few Words About Digital Photography Vs Traditional Film Photography  Contrary to popular belief digital photography and traditional film photography remain two separate and distinct mediums  Digital photography IS NOT going to replace traditional film photography any time in the foreseeable future  Both mediums have their strengths and their weaknesses and smart photographers will dismiss the hype and hyperbole and utilize each medium to its maximum capability for the applications it is best suited for  Digital photography is very convenient and it is possible to shoot digital images and utilize them only moments later  something that cannot be done with traditional 35mm film which must be processed first  Digital images  with the use of image manipulation programs like AdobePhotoShop  are capable of much more manipulation than traditional film images  Reality need not be a limiting factor for the digital photographer  who has the ability to create not only images that have never existed before  but also images that  in reality  could not possibly exist  What digital photography cannot do is show the nuances in contrast  depth of field effect  edge sharpness  bokeh  and color tonal dynamic range that traditional  especially slow slide and fine grain B W  film is capable of  The current crop of high resolution four and five megapixel digital cameras offer photographers more options than ever before  Good 11X14 enlargements of uncompressed digital image files are possible for the first time with consumer level digital cameras  Make no mistake digital 11X14 s will not outshine 11X14 enlargements made with slow speed slide  or fine grain B W  film  especially if they are viewed with a good quality 4X 6X loupe  Slow speed slide and fine grain B W film will produce acceptable to good 16X20 enlargements  something that is not possible with digital image files at this time unless they are custom printed Be careful that you don t fall into the digital photography is cheaper trap  because that argument doesn t hold any water  Digital cameras can cost from 3 to 10 times as much as a similar film camera  here s an example  the Nikon N65 film SLR runs about  300 and the Fuji Finepix S1 Pro Digital SLR  which actually has fewer features  runs about  2300  CF SM Memory Stick IBM MicroDrive storage media  the  film  for digital cameras  can add from  50 to  500 to the price of your digital camera  depending on capacity  Film cameras last longer and the technology moves much more slowly  Whatever digital camera you buy today is already two generations behind the cutting edge  manufacturers are in the final R D stages with the next digital camera and they are simultaneously working on the development of the successor to that model  and even more troubling are serious concerns about digital print longevity and technological obsolescence rendering digital image files un retrievable in the future b Do You Really Need a 4 or 5 Megapixel Digital Camera b Probably not  unless you are a serious amateur photographer or a professional  If you ve been using a pro 35mm SLR and pro quality zoom or prime  fixed focal length  lenses and shooting slow slide or fine grain B W film  then you are probably going to need a four or five megapixel digital to give you image quality that is comparable to what you are used to  If you ve been shooting with 35mm amateur SLR s  consumer level zooms  and color print film  then you are probably going to love digital photography  and if you shoot primarily snapshots  family  friends  life events  vacation  then you probably won t need anything more than a very good 2 megapixel  or if you occasionally want 8X10 enlargements  a good 3 megapixel  point and shoot  digital camera b Features  i Exposure  The

The weather here in Kentucky has been pretty typical for this time of year with warm pretty days followed by cold gray rainy days  My Friend  who sells and distributes photographic equipment  showed up the Saturday before St  Patrick s Day with a brand new S40 and asked if I wanted come out and play  My friend thought the compact stainless steel S40 body looked very cool and the sliding lens cover reminded him of the classic WWII Minox spy camera  We tested the S40 over the course of the St  Patrick s Day weekend  which was cold  gray  and rainy not optimal camera testing weather  We first set up a macro stage  Children  you can try this at home for directions see my review of the Olympus E 20N digital camera the URL is listed below  and spread out a collection of brightly colored plastic beach toys  on a white background  that we use to test digital camera color  After manually white balancing the camera we used the S40 to shoot brightly colored red  green  blue  and yellow plastic shapes  The S40 s colors were well saturated and accurate  The camera s White Balance handled the test lighting pretty well  though we both noticed a very slight warm cast with the Auto setting  The Manual white balance setting produced the best results  The S40 had some difficulty with incandescent  yellow  lighting  without flash  but when used with the flash the incandescent setting achieved nearly neutral results in the close range  The S40 s white balance worked better than most of the current digital cameras available under artificial lighting  The S40 s performance in this test was virtually identical to the tests we had done with the Canon G2  The PowerShot S40 takes about four seconds to extend the lens and  power up  before you can start shooting  Shutter lag is quite short  but longer than 35mm shutter lag times  The RAW mode is a great feature because it produces a much smaller file than the TIFF image modes of other cameras  RAW images from the S40 run about 2800 Kb and a TIFF file might run as high as 9000 Kb  Canon includes a RAW to TIFF software conversion application in the S40 s bundle b St  Patrick s Day  After finishing the basic color test we took the S40 outdoors to shoot some  street  shots of the colorfully clad characters returning from the St  Patrick s Day Parade  Our local St  Patrick s Day celebration has a much more provincial flavor than those in New York and Boston  with the spectators making up for their lack of sophistication with an abundance of enthusiasm and creativity  We spent about an hour shooting revelers wandering back and forth along Bardstown Road between the city s Irish Pubs  most of which are located in the Highlands  The S40 produced consistently great color images of the passionate St  Paddy s Day partyers  especially considering how dreary and gray the weather was  Caucasian skin tones in our Outdoor tests came out a little pink  but that may have been more a result of the brisk breeze and mid thirties temperatures than anything relevant to the S40 s performance  Optical distortion with the excellent 3X zoom was lower than average at the wide angle end  and the telephoto setting produced virtually distortion free images  Chromatic aberration  purple fringing  was noticeable but well controlled  The zoom displayed some noticeable softness in the corners of the frame  Low light performance was well above average  Noise in longer exposures is well controlled  even at the ISO 400 setting  Macro performance is very good with high resolution in close up images  The S40 s flash performance is about average for point n shoot digital cameras  a bit weak for general shooting and a little hot for macro work  The S40 is surprisingly fast  shutter lag is almost non existent  and shot to shot times are excellent   Mid America Trucking Show  The following Saturday we got together Saturday afternoon to visit the Mid America Trucking Show  the largest  Trucking Theme Show  in the world  More than 1 000 000 square feet of the cavernous West Wing of the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center is given over to this diesel extravaganza  The show started right here in Louisville in 1971 and has gown bigger every year since  The Mid America Trucking Show draws more than 80 000 visitors to the Bluegrass State every spring to see the most beautifully painted and most technologically advanced trucks on the planet  My friend and I wanted to go because we had seen some shots of some the fantastic paint jobs on these diesel behemoths in TV ads for the show  Many of the fanciest trucks are entered in the Paul K  Young Memorial Truck Beauty Championship  Young was the founder the Truck show and after his death in 1998 the organizers wanted a signature event named after him  the truck beauty contest is a natural  Some of the Semi s entered in the contest have wonderfully complex murals that stretch the full length of the Cab and Trailer  just the sort of colorful stuff that is perfect for camera tests  All the illumination at the Kentucky Fair and Exposition center is fluorescent  so the truck show provided an excellent opportunity to check out the accuracy of the S40 s white balance system  which worked beautifully  There were also many people photography opportunities with more than 80 000 attendees from all fifty states and more than forty foreign countries and over 1000 exhibitors b A Few Concerns  The 3X zoom lens on the S40 is not threaded for use with add on lens adapters or filters  and this a really vexing omission  The built in flash is pretty weak and Canon chose not to provide any capability for using external flash  another glaring omission in a four megapixel digital camera  Battery life is decent  Canon says 180 200 images with constant LCD use and over 400 using only the optical viewfinder  we got a bit more than two hours of heavy use from a fully charged battery  moderate LCD use  The included 16Mb standard CF card isn t going to provide enough storage for anything more than a minor event  You ll need to purchase at least one 64Mb card and an additional battery to fully utilize the S40   Conclusion  After we finished our tests we printed the two best St  Patrick s Day image pairs at 5X7 and 8X10 and two 8X10 s from the truck show on an Epson Stylus Photo EPX 785 that we ve been testing  watch for the upcoming review of this exciting  digital darkroom  tool  We then carefully inspected the printed images using a Mamiya 4X loupe designed for checking medium format prints  they were as good as similar images we d printed from the G2  Color  contrast  resolution  and subjective  look  were comparable to any four megapixel digital camera currently available in terms of image quality  The S40 is an excellent general use digital camera that offers users just about all the manual exposure controls they might want  but works beautifully for neophyte photographers who want to shoot creative high quality digital images without learning basic photography skills  Recommended without reservation Are you considering spreading your imaging wings and setting up a  digital darkroom b  Check out

Auto, Right before graduation  my  87 Grand Am finally rolled over and died  Faced with college and a summer job  I needed a car  Quick  After searching the Tulsa car market and coming up broke  except for a  95 Eclipse with known mechanical problems  my uncle s wife s sister s 1997 Dodge Avenger was our solution  I paid  6 000 for my  pull me over red  2 5 litre 4cylinder and could not be happier with it  The motor runs almost silently  and with 96k miles on it  the biggest repair I m currently looking at is replacing the idler belt and the timing chain  These motors  along with the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talons have a known problem with the timing belt chain  In the Avenger  the problem has been acknowledged and the housing for the timing chain is on top of the motor for easy access  unlike those in Chevrolets and Fords  My biggest complaint is the ambiguity of the owner s manual  my dad is a do it yourself mechanic and refuses to take cars to the shop  The owner s manual has a few vague solutions for when the  Check Engine  light comes on  as mine recently has  so dad is having to systematically go through the engine and make small repairs while trying to find the real problem  Also  my Avenger has a very low turning radius  friends make fun of me when I back in and out of a spot trying to line it up  and I haven t quite nailed parallel parking in it yet  Sean  will you come park her car  She doesn t know how  Also  I have to turn off the air conditioning to get up enough speed to enter the expressway  the acceleration is very slow  but all in all  I love my new car  
Auto, I got a 4 door Kia Sportage because I needed the four wheel drive capabilities for where I was living at the time and I loved it  It would go just about anywhere I wanted to go and it was comfortable for me to drive I am over six feet tall  The dashboard is set up in a very readable manner and everything is within reach of the driver  You can haul people and stuff without being crowded together  I moved in it and didn t have a problem with space  It is very comfortable for long drives or just running to the store  it doesn t have overly hard or uncomfortable seats like most of the SUV s I have driven or ridden in  It is a good buy for just about anyone who likes to go four wheeling or just drive around br br  
Camera, I won mine in an online contest  It was so great to be among the winners  It really only cost me about 3 95 for faxing in my winners confirmation form  The shipping was even paid  When I received it via UPS I was totally clueless how to use a digital camera as I had never so much as touched one  It was very easy to learn how to use it though and super easy to use the software bundle that came with it to move my pictures from the camera to the computer  Here is what I found when I opened the box  ePhoto CL30 digital camera 4 MB CompactFlash memory card 4 cheap AA batteries Digital Camera soft case Agfa PhotoWise software with PhotoGenie technology for managing  and enhancing digital images and Twain driver Serial cable for PC Mac adapter cable USB cable Video cable Help Manual Here is what your PC will need to operate this camera  PC System Requirements  50 MB of available hard disk space VGA monitor with at least 256 colors Microsoft Windows 95  98 or NT Pentium processor or higher RS 232 9 pin port or USB port 2x or faster CD ROM Macintosh System Requirements  System 7 5 3 or higher Power PC processor Modem or USB port  Source  Quoted from box the camera came in  It is very lightweight but seems to be built exceptionally well  The pictures it takes are fabulous  Here is a link to some pictures I took with this camera the day after getting it http www crosswinds net heidiklaus purrsonal pageeleven html I also like this camera because it is very attractive looking  I love the grey silver color  I have seen other digital cameras that were just hideous and I would not be caught dead carrying  I am also fascinated with the LCD display on the back of the camera  It reminded me of using my video camera  I don t know if all digital cameras come with one but the AGFA ePhoto CL30 does  I wish I had had this on many regular cameras too  It would have made it that much easier to get a good shot  I was also very pleased that everything that was needed to start using the camera immediately was included right down to having batteries  I was taking pictures with it in seconds  and within minutes was loading them into my PC for editing  I am sold on AGFA digital cameras and I doubt very highly I will ever buy another brand  If I get one as a gift though I will try it out  One drawback is  and I am sure it is like this with all digital cameras  that it eats batteries  I was able to get around that by buying an adapter so I can plug it in when I am not using it out of doors  The adapter is a bit expensive but you save money on batteries and it is more environment friendly than the batteries are  I wonder if there is a digital camera with a video camera type battery that will last so many hours  That would be really nice  The Agfa ePhoto CL30 may be my first digital camera but in my opinion  it is hands down the best one  I would buy this as a gift for anyone     
Camera, Go out  look at all the models available in this range  as a matter of fact look at higher priced models  I dare you to find a better overall value for quality and features than the Fuji s602Z  The best price value around  No camera is perfect  they all have their pros and cons but look at all the pros and the few cons on this one and you will be sold  I know this sounds like an advertisement but the s602z is just that good  One of the fastest cameras you will ever find  The closest thing to an SLR without the size  weight and cost  The features are endless  just look at the list below for a few  Besides those  it just takes great pictures with no effort and fantastic pictures with a little effort  Look around the many Fuji Forums like the one at dpreview com and you can find thousands of sample pics that show the quality this camera can give  It also just feels good in your hand  menu system and dual function buttons  using a shift button  give you good quick control to most of the features  Try it  You ll like it  The value is incredible  Some of the feature that was important in my decision to buy it was  6x Zoom 15sec to 1 10 000 sec shutter speeds 5FPS mode Last 5Frames mode 40 pic motor drive Auto Bracketing Shooting Priority Modes  Aperture  Shutter  Sports  Landscape  Portrait  Night  B W  Full Manual or Full Auto Shift button menu functions Manual Focus with quick focus button Both Smartmedia and CF Microdrive Memory Slots Uses 4 AA batteries  I use NiMH rechargeable  View last picture before saving incl  multiple frame modes Histogram view before saving 640x480 30FPS Movie mode with sound  Can fill memory  VERY short lag time from shot to shot  You can add filters  Wide Tele lenses The list just goes on and on  And on top of it all  great quality pictures with up to 6MP resolution  it is an interpolated 6MP but comparable to at least 4MP on other cameras  and has gorgeous printed pictures  Buy this camera and you will not be sorry  I m not   
Auto, My Mazda delivered everything I hoped for for the price and more  I bought it fresh out of college  and drove it happily for three years until totalling it in an accident  WHO WOULD LOVE ONE A college student  recent grad  or family on a budget who are looking for reliability and a car they won t be ashamed to drive  but not necessarily something too flashy PROS  My Mazda never once broke down  refused to start  stalled  or underperformed  The ride was more comfortable with 5 passengers than any other car I ve ridden in for its size  It also handled multiple carseats well when babysitting  and the back doors  openings were wide enough to be practical loading packages  pets  or kids  It was great on gas  30 34MPG with an automatic  easy to park  and had plenty of storage space in the trunk  It handled very well in NH snow   a very big concern for me in the purchase decision  Braking and steering were very comfortable and responsive  Car was powerful enough to merge into traffic in a short distance    It had a good package of standard safety features  Visibility was overall very good  unlike some comparable 1997 makes with huge blind spots    When I priced insurance rates on it and other cars I was considering in its price class  the rates for the Mazda were lower than its competitors THE ACCIDENT   A BIG PRO The only reason I am not still driving this car is a big reason I would recommend it to others  I was in an accident where I was hit from the drivers side so hard that I spun into a guard rail  hitting it head on at about 20 mph  I am happy to report that the car performed above and beyond my expectations in this situation  Both airbags deployed  and my seatbelt obviously worked well  as I would expect  The crumple zones certainly crumpled   the car looked a mess  However  considering the force of both impacts  and the fact that I walked away without so much as a scratch  says a great deal to me about the safety of the car  As a side note  as a smaller woman  the force of the airbags was not enough to hurt me  and the design of the car allowed easy enough reach of the controls that I did not have to sit on top of the steering wheel like in other cars I ve driven The car also had low impact bumpers  where another car  nudged  me a few times  and there were no dents or scratches left CONS  Acceleration could have been better  particularly when the car was heavily loaded  or when going uphill  The road noise was more prominent than in some of its competitors  Baseline models are BASELINE   no frills there  The factory speakers weren t great   I ended up upgrading the stereo system  including the speakers    The transmission would sometimes shift a little heavily  and was not as smooth as other cars I ve ridden in  
Camera, I originally bought this digital camera from Best Buy for a whopping  80  I  at the time  thought this was an excellent price  Being a complete novice to digital camera shopping  I didn t realize that this digital camera listed no MegaPixel rating  This so called camera sits atop my computer desk as we speak  gathering dust  The battery holder lid is now missing  which means I cannot disconnect the camera from the computer since it cannot receive power any other way  The USB is like no other  meaning they can sell it exclusively for an insane  15  Not to mention that the USB cord is extremely short  I must say  this digital camera has been dropped  banged  and been through multiple moving vans  and still takes quality pictures  or at least what Aiptek calls  quality  Overall  this camera has some nice features  It records voice  though sound quality is terrible  works as a webcam  though resolution is limited  and can take high and low resolution pictures  though they both are horrible  horrible quality  This camera is also extremely light sensitive  Don t even think about taking indoor pictures  because there has to be blaring and blinding light shining on the scene for it to take the picture  If there is not enough lighting  the camera will make a low  annoying beep  If there is adequate lighting  it will make an even more annoying high pitched beep  The picture quality is grainy and just overall atrocious  High resolution pictures have to be shrunken to at least 300x300 to look remotely nice  My last words are  Do not buy this product unless you re that desperate  This Christmas I m buying myself the Concord Eye Q Go 2000 2 Megapixel camera  I recommend you do the same  and never think about buying this camera ever again  
Camera, As an amateur photographer who prefers a manual focus SLR and prime lenses for control and picture quality  I wanted a digital camera to take snapshots and as a  backup  camera for traveling pictures  My search led to the Sony DSC P71  a 3 2 megapixel camera with optional manual focus and digital settings that provide some decent options for picture taking  To my surprise  the P71 is a great little picture taker that often rivals the best of my Nikon  It has a very nice feature  an autofocus illuminator  that enables the camera to focus even in the dark as long as your subject is within about ten feet  It also has very little  shutter lag  allowing you to take pictures in normal conditions quickly one after another  It has a comprehensive and simple menu that is displayed at your option on the bright and colorful LCD screen  And it allows you to format the pictures in the camera itself by zooming in and trimming as you like it  the only danger is that too much zooming will undermine the quality of your picture  You can also set it to Landscape  Twilight or Twilight Portrait Mode  The last mode takes excellent photos of people at night yet still shows the city light background  It also has a 3x optical zoom that is excellent  but I do not recommend using the additional 2x digital zoom  Again  this will make your pictures too grainy  Another nice feature  it really feels like a camera  It s sturdy  the right size and has the LCD on the middle right where it should be  This way your left thumb can rest where it belongs  on the left side of the camera  Too many digitals have the LCD screens on the left where your thumb belongs The initial memory  stick  of 16 megabytes is inadequate  I bought a 64 MG that holds 40 3 megapixel photos at one time  The provided battery charger is slow  it takes at least ten hours to charge  I bought a  one hour  charger that will recharge two backups in about 90 minutes  With these optional purchases the P71 is a complete package The P71 is made for connectivity  It has a USB port to a computer and a video out that allows you to put on a slide show directly from your camera  very nice  And the memory stick can be plugged directly into most printers today  It also has an adapter slot to connect to your wall to save batteries There are  of course  some negatives  There is no external flash  The internal flash is superior for a point and shoot camera  but a through the lens external flash would be better  There is no sound even for the movie mode  so don t get it if you want this to be your video camera  also  The Pixel software for showing and adjusting your pictures is almost incomprehensible  The Help brings up instructions but they are unclear and at times incomprehensible  The adjustment features are rudimentary and the interface with Windows is terrible  The one time I did call Pixela service for help I got a very nice live person almost immediately  but the software still stinks  Thank goodness I already had Adobe Photoshop on my computer If you want a great digital camera that takes fantastic snapshots  that s compact and easy to use  then consider the 3 2 megapixel P71  It s all you will ever need and it s very quick for a digital camera  If you want movie sound  full manual controls  changeable lenses  external flash or to print out still shots larger than 8 x 10  consider a digital SLR or the Sony DSC 85  For most amateurs this is all the digital camera you will ever need  
Auto, This is my first vehicle that is not a car  I have never owned a motorcycle  motorhome  pickup truck or anything else other than mostly big roomy sedans  I like my creature comforts when tooling down the highway enroute to one golf resort or another  With about a year left to go on the Oldsmobile I got to thinking about minivans  and decided to do some research  I relied  too  on a friend who is now in his third straight minivan  no Fords for advice on what  besides the cupholders  are the advantages of minivan ownership  I used the Internet to do the research  relying heavily on Kelly Blue Book  www kbb com   and www edmunds com  Both are really good sites whether you are buying or leasing  and whether it s a car or a truck  Bottom line is that between them and my buddy  although he is absolutely not a Windstar guy  I decided that if I was getting a minivan it was going to be Ford s  It was a close call over the Honda Odyssey  Truth is there are a lot of great vehicles out there nowadays  Maybe you won t go wrong with any of them  but I am thinking that for the money you can t get much safer or more comfortable  I ve been driving mine now for about four months  and I believe that I am ready to evaluate it  I don t know much at all about the technical stuff  but I do know that I am satisfied with the gas mileage  The ride is nice  of course  when your vehicle is new you are careful to miss most bumps larger than a bottlecap  but nevertheless I did not miss a few and I can tell you from experience  It s a nice ride  I got the SE model with the  quot radar quot  in the back  That s the rear sensing system that saved me from an accident in a supermarket parking lot this past week  I never saw the guy  and I never would have had a chance if it wasn t for that alarm going off just in the nick of time  It s been the better part of 30 thirty years since I hit something I wasn t aiming at  and I can tell you I am real grateful for this alarm system  It would have been a minor ding I am sure  but it would have ruined a great driving record  Thanks again Ford  If this model doesn t have enough bells and whistles for you  well I gotta tell you that you are pretty spoiled  No matter though  they have two others  I think  loaded with even more stuff if you have to have it  The right side back door opens and closes at the push of a button  That s pretty neat  makes me wish I had gotten the left door that way too  You know what else is pretty neat  the outside mirrors   not only are they  quot powered mirrors quot  they are heated  To melt the ice which we will be getting our fair share of starting any day now  No more scraping mirrors  Works for me  I could go on with what I like about it  but if you re looking to buy one of these or one of the competition s versions  then I better tell you what I don t like about it as well  Gotta be fair  The right front door cannot be opened with a key   there is NO keyhole  My vehicle has  quot keyless entry quot  so I shouldn t complain  but I don t keep that little  quot doo jigger quot  on my keyring  It s my emergency backup in case I stupidly leave my keys in the car  again  and sometimes it would be handy to access that door with a key  For someone else or for packages  for example  I am not crazy about my cupholders  The ones in the front section of the car just under the radio that you have to pull out like a drawer  Well  they re a little chintzy if you ask me  I don t trust them to hold my medium diet pepsi  and they don t hold my coffee mug  So  what are they good for  Like the song says  quot Absolutely Nothin quot  The only other thing that really bugs me is the back door lift gate or whatever they call it  If anything ought to be  quot powered quot  this is it  I m guessing that if there is one feature that costs Ford the most customers this would have to be it  I believe that the Ford people would do well to hire themselves a woman engineer to check this door out from the point of view of people who are less than 6 1  220  and make it so it s a wee bit more user friendly  Dumbest door I ve ever seen  If you are thinking minivan for your next purchase  You might want to just take my word for it  I did the research  Windstar is a good deal br br  
Camera, Well  first off  this was my first digital camera  but I had done extensive amounts of research on them before coming to my conclusion  The main deciding factor was the price i was able to get it for off of Ebay  Well  the first thing that caught my eye  was the nice size  It is a nice travel companion  The 2 1 megapixels also helped because i knew i didnt want to go below two and have only internet worthy pics  but I wanted some power  I have taken this camera with me everywhere  and it has only failed me when i failed it  forgot to charge battery  wrong picture quality chosen  The case is amazing  I never would have thought that a company could make such a strong  metal  attractive case  and make it appealing to comsumers and professionals alike  Because most digital cameras on the market now  will be made of pure weak plastic shells  and a good strong case is a thing to look for if you want the camera to last  and this one will  With only one exception on my opinion  the jog dial  I had the camera in my pocket one day and i was on the tile floor  and i slipped and fell  Good news  no broken circuitry  bad news  the jog dial fell off  Nothing a little super glue and a fine tuned eye couldnt fix  like 6 pieces were involved  The most impressive aspects of this camera really got to shine when i was taking close ups  very good detail  night shots with flash  and black and white  very crisp images  One of the things i didnt like was the fact that there were no image settings like sepia  of negative  only black and white  A very handy feature on this little guy is the half touch focus  You push down the shutter button halfway and it auto focuses  One of the things i didnt like  was the 16 frame movie mode  It was useful on a rare occasion because it is basicaly taking 16 pictures them seaming them into one big picture  not in any movie format  just a colage  If you do take that kind of a movie  you can watch it on the camera  no sound  jerky  but not on your computer  The software features one very handy feature QuickFix  this is a one click solution to unscrewing the pictures that the camera screwed up in quality  Other than that on the software  i just use it to download the pics to the computer which is easy enough for me  You can adjust the cameras bulb speeds  which i havent found handy yet  but yet is the key word  I love the LCD display so much compared to all of the ones offered on sony models and so on  it is very crisp  bright and easy to read  The LCD leads me to the battery life  which can be greatly reduced with the use of the LCD  The battery just never seemed to pull throught when i needed it most  but hey  for what you can buy this camera for these days  you might as well get a better battery  right  Since im not a professional photographer  and I dont get paid for the pictures i take  Me and the PDR M4 are a perfect match  but hey  who says a pro could tell the difference  most can t  Over all  this camera is a great buy  the only camera that i will warn you not to buy if your life depends on it  is a sony mavica with a floppy drive  they are fat  loud  too bright  horrible picture quality  heavy  yet people and schools still buy them  don t waste your money  go for the PDR M4 it is worth every penny  
Camera, Got this camera a week ago  and have been very pleased with it  I have lots of 35mm gear  which I use for more  quot serious quot  hobby photography  and so the main qualities I wanted in a digital camera were portability and cost savings in film processing  I think it is a great compliment to my other cameras  Since I will use this mainly for sharing photos online with my family  where the resolution does not need to be so high  I thought this camera would be convenient The powershot uses compact flash cards  so if you go on vacation and don t have access to a computer to dump your pictures onto  you may want to pick up extra memory  I got 2 48MB cards  in addition to the 8MB that comes with it  The battery doesn t last very long if you use the LCD screen  but I usually look thru the viewfinder anyways  The menu system took a little while to get used to  but now it seems very natural and well laid out  There are a few tricks that are in the manual that you wouldn t figure out by just using the camera  For instance  to see the picture you just took  keep holding down the shutter release button  Then  you can also delete it immediately Connecting the camera to a computer to download pictures is really simple  Just install the software that comes on CD  and when you plug the camera into your USB port  the software will automatically start  Works great on both my iMac  and my PC A really cool thing is the photo stitch feature and software  You can make a panorama by combining several photos together  Using the lcd screen  you can line up shots side by side  then using the software  you can stitch or merge the photos together to get a very wide shot  You can even do a 360 degree panorama and make a Quicktime VR movie with the software  I did this on my Mac  and it can do it on the PC too  if you have Quicktime 4 installed The quality of the images is fantastic  I am upgrading from a Sony DSC F1 Cybershot which is a few years old  and only did 640x480  The Canon s resolution is so much better  file size is bigger too  and you have the option of 3 sizes  Switching between them is easy The camera is so small  I carry it around with me all the time  After lugging around my 35mm gear  this is like a dream  Of course  you don t have any depth of field control with this camera  you can adjust exposure   2  I think  but as a handy point and shoot  it is fantastic  Also  since it uses the same  or close to it  body as the other Canon APS Elph IXY cameras  it is more discreet  With my cybershot  I had to always deal with questions about that camera  Not a big deal  but still  People are more comfortable when a picture is taken with a  quot normal quot  camera  looking thru the viewfinder I think we will have this camera for years to come  I recommend it br br  
Camera, I bought this camera because my daughter had one and was very happy with it  I  also  love the camera  I have only had the camera for 3 weeks but have used it a lot  I wanted the camera to capture important family events  I was able to take pictures of my grandson s prom and graduation  It gave me the opportunity to review pictures to make sure I had good shots instead of waiting to have the film developed only to find I had lousy pictures  Percentage of good pictures have far exceeded those taken with my 35mm camera  The review function allows you view and eliminate pictures that are not good thus giving you more space on your picture card  I suggest buying a larger picture card if you are planning on taking many pictures before saving them to a disk or computer br br  
Auto, About ten years ago I would not have been caught dead driving a Ford Escort  They were the bottom of the food chain as far as I was concerned  However  Ford again came up with a  better idea  and designed the Escort ZX2 I bought my 1998 Escort ZX2 new after owning a 1989 Thunderbird for nine years  I had prepared myself for a big adjustment but was pleasantly surprised  I first chose the ZX2 because of its low price and sporty look  When I test drove my car  I fell in love  The four cylinder  front wheel drive car offered a smooth ride and was quick to pick up speed from stop signs After I bought the car and drove it on a daily basis  I enjoyed it even more  The fuel mileage is excellent and after almost 26 000 miles the only repair I have had done is a cracked windshield  The car still looks sharp  drives great  and offers a comfortable ride I would recommend the Escort ZX2 for a single person or a married couple with no more than one child  The car has a fair amount of interior and trunk space  However  riding with four adults in the car and the air conditioning on takes a definite toll on the power and fuel mileage The only thing I have found that I do not like about my car is the lack of a mirror on the sun visor  Perhaps this has been added to the newer ZX2 s  
Camera, Hello all  it s been a while since I wrote an Epinion  I have a few new Digicams to write about  this Epinion is about my  newest  aquisition  I work for Staples here in N E  PA ans one day a customer came in with an old digital camera he got on ebay  it was in a bundle pack of cameras he bid on   he wanted an Olympus cam that was in the pack  he had this other cam that was in there  he wanted to see if it worked  and if it did he was giving it to his pastor  anyway it worked  and had me interested  I went online to look at this cam and see what it s specs were  it seemed interesting  and the more I read the more I wanted one  so off to ebay I went  took a while to win on one  seems they are very popular now  used to be a  1 000 00 camera in it s day  1997  they now go for between  20 00 and  100 00  give or take  I got mine for  36 00 with shipping and insurance  Paypal  It arrived as they said it would  as is  no books  no software  and no cables  just the camera  I put in 4 Ni MH AA batteries  and a 16 MB Compact flash card that I had here  and turned the play switch on  it came on  so far so good  I turned it off  and slid the on switch for taking pics to the open side  exposing the front of the viewfinder  and the flash sensor  and powering the cam  it made some noises and the rear lcd came to life  telling me I had around 60 pics  was set to best mode  has 4 levels of quality  good  better  best   and uncompressed  which actually still has some compression actually  Kodak lied about a few things back then  I ll get to more on this later  anyway  I anxiously aimed the cam at one of my cats  and pressed the shutter down 1 2 way  the cam focused  and the ready light blinked  I pressed the rest of the way  the flash went off  and the cam saved the pic  I went back to the playback  and the pic came up on screen  it worked   smiles  so I got a working one  and in good shape too  only a little dust inside the lens  Time to experiment  smiles  Well  first the main specs of the cam  and I ll mention where Kodak lied  Resolution 1280x960  making this a 1 2MP cam  Actual Chip resolution 850x984  or 836 400 pixels  so in fact this isn t a megapixel cam as Kodak claimed  ahh well  for me no big deal  as I allready knew this Memory  built in  2 MB  also takes CF cards  up to at least 128 MB that I tested 24 bit color depth ISO equivalent of ISO 160  so it s just about a good all around cam 3x Optical zoom  no digital zoom Auto Focus 2 3 ft to Infinity  using IR for focusing Close up focus 0 7 feet to 1 6 feet  0 2 to 0 5 m Zoom Length 38mm to 114 mm 35 MM cam equivalent  Actual Focal Length 7mm to 21 mm Flash range on Wide  2 3 Ft to 16 4 feet  on tele 2 3 ft to 10 8 Feet Aperture  Wide f 2 5 to f 16 Tele f 3 8 to f 24 Shutter Speed  one of the things I liked  1 500th to 16 seconds  great for night shots Viewfinder zooming optical  Now like I said  I only got the cam  nothing else  but I do have card readers for CF cards  so no biggie  I put the card in to the reader  and checked the pics  Kodak used a different picture file format here  it ends with a  kdc  it s actually a form of  jpg  I know because the HP Photosmart printers we have at work will let you see the pic  but on thre it looks blurry  minor differences make it unuseable this way right from the cam  Normally i d have been stuck without the conversion software Kodak uses  but luckily you can DL it from Kodak  or use any other program that reads  kdc format  Paint Shop Pro 7 does  as does Irfanview  for examples  the cam saves all pics in the 1280x960 resolution  interpolating them up from 850x960  so they look a little soft  not sharp  a little resizing to 850x637  which is what they are when you try to match the resolution horizontaly  without loosing the aspect ratio helps to sharpen the pics up  as does using the sharpening controls of your favorite photo editor  once you save the file as a  jpg or whatever you like  I find that irfanview s sharpening filter or Photoshops Unsharp Mask work best  making the pics useable for web and also printing  up to 5x7 depending on the pic  I have been taking this cam everywhere with me  along with my other new cam  my Toshiba PDR 3300 3 2 MP  they both have good and bad sides and work well as a combo  the DC120 will focus in ANY light even darkness  since it uses IR  the toshiba uses edge detection  so the subject has to have some light on it for focus  This cam is not hard to use once you figure the controls out  it can be used 1 handed  once you set the zoom  there is a hand strap on the right side  like a camcorder  keeping the cam on your hand well  you don t use the viewscreen on back to set up the shot  you can  but it works better if you don t  and saves batteries  There are some bad parts to this cam  for one  it s a discontinued cam  so no support really from Kodak  2 you have to buy them used  so who knows what condition they will be in  but the price is usually good there can be defects on the cam  for example  mine has a slight problem with hot pixels showing up on dark photos  hot pixels look liek white specks in the pic  not a major prob  unless taking pics of a starry sky  smiles  Mine also has dust inside the lens  so far I don t think it s affected the pics  When taking pics in the highest quality mode  it takes about 10 seconds to save the pic  and be ready for the next one  so it s a bit slow  just plan your shots right  smiles  Some features I liked  and also made me get one of these were  When shooting close up mode  the display comes on when you hold the shuter down 1 2 way  letting you see the pic better than using the viewfinder  also  when in close up mode you manually focus the cam  using the zoom buttons  also shows the distance focused for on the little lcd  This is the only time the cam has manual focus  but I still like it  I liek the shape of it  it is the size of a good sized paperback novel  and you use it looking down the longest part of the cam  like binoculars sort of It s not a heavy cam  has a big lens  letting in more light it seems  and I been told it uses a CCD imaging chip as opposed to a CMOS chip like the cheaper cams now use  allowing for better color reproduction  I have gotten some VERy nice pictures from this cam  you can still get add on lenses and filters for this cam used and new  check with Tiffen  I love the IR focus system  hasn t really failed me yet  and seems right on the money when it focuses  Now  don t get me wrong  this cam isn t as good as my Toshiba PDR 3300 for serious pictures  the 3 2 MP images are very sharp  But it makes a nice 2nd cam  replacing my other cams I reviewed in previous epinions for the most part  I for one am VERY happy with this cam  and would suggest that anyone interested in a very inexpensive cam to play around with  check ebay and try to get one  unless you get a defective unit  you won t be disapointed  that s all for now  if you have any questions or comments  please submit them here  or e mail at jbach37 yahoo com And again  thank you for reading  John 
Auto, I grew up worshiping the quality of Japanese  German and Swedish cars  but I have to admit  my last few years driving this very inexpensive Ford have convinced me to consider another one the next time I need a new car  While it isn t much to look at  it has been immensely practical and reliable  I inherited this vehicle from my parents  and as a poor college student at the time I couldn t say no  despite its  quot grocery getter quot  nature  Now that I own a house  commute 20 miles to work in heavy traffic  and park in cramped lots  I appreciate its sizable cargo space  good gas mileage  and nimble handling  I recently recommended it to a friend and I recommend it to anyone out there who is looking for this type of vehicle  it is small and agile  with an excellent turning radius  it gets about 35mpg on mixed driving  can haul a lot more than you would think  and it s very reliable  Mine has 119k miles with only minimal maintenance  new belts and an alternator at 100k  and oil every 3 5k  It is a small car with a small engine  1 9L  so don t expect to outrun anyone  but it does have enough pickup for a normal driving  even in the aggressive Washington  DC traffic  The biggest problem  it s a station wagon and it looks like it  If you can swallow your pride  you ll save a lot of money with car br br  
Auto, I should clarify that I got this as a rental  I didn t ask for it  but they had already given away the standard full size car I wanted  So they  quot upgraded quot  me to the town car  I think it s called the Town Car because you could fit the population of a small town inside it  As big as it is  I thought it would be unmanuverable and slow  It s not  It accelerates quickly  but the only way I knew was to look at the speedometer  You can t feel a thing in this car  Driving a Town Car is a lot like sitting on a plush  comfy couch while playing a really good driving simulator on a computer  The seats are amazingly comfortable  and the car has less engine road noise than any vehicle I have ever seen  There is no feedback from the road and the steering is incredibly sensitive  I kept wandering in the lane because the slightest pressure on the wheel and the car changes direction  Inattention could be disasterous because the first warning that you have turned would be the crunch of the bumper b Man that s big b  Not that hitting a guardrail would harm you  The bumper is waaay at the front of the car  Outside of a heavy truck I can t think of many vehicles that would be safer than this one  Besides the normal complement of air bags  it also has a warning light that bongs  at you if the driver hasn t buckled the seat belt  If I owned this car that would be the first fuse to come out  It doesn t easily fit into parking spaces  Six people could easily ride in it and the trunk is large enough to sleep two  But it doesn t look bad  The styling is very nice  and it s a very comfortable car in all respects  Surprisingly for such a big car  it still gets about 20MPG in mixed driving  Not great  but I was expecting faster fuel consumption b How do I b Everything in this car is powered  The seat  quot remembers quot  your settings and when you stop the car it pulls back to allow you to get out easier  When you start the car it slides you to your preferred position  The seat controls are extensive and far easier to use than in my Grand Prix  The button is shaped like a seat and you just push it in the direction you want to go  The gas and trunk buttons are right there on the door  There is also a very useful display near the speedometer that shows your current direction  fuel mileage  ect  Radio and climate control buttons are provided on the steering wheel  but there isn t enough of them to control either adequately  There are so many buttons it takes time to figure them all out  I figured the climate control out  and in Atlanta A C is important  Driver storage space is excellent  There is a fold down armrest with plenty of space and there is a small map compartment in the door armrest  This is a nice luxury car that really pampers you  If you want to really feel your driving  look elsewhere     
Camera, If you are in the market for your first digital camera and do not want to spend a lot of money  then this camera is for you The HP PhotoSmart digital camera allows you to take pictures that can be downloaded onto your computer or viewed on your television screen  Some of the features are 1152 x 872 resolution 8mb removable CompactFlash memory card 1 8 LCD Monitor 2x digital zoom auto focus red eye reduction If you do decide to buy this camera  make sure you buy the battery charger and rechargeable batteries  The camera came with regular batteries  so I used them  By the time I took 22 picture using the  quot Fine quot  photo quality mode and downloaded them to my PC  the batteries were dead  The download was a little slow  It took over 5 minutes to download the pictures on a Pentium 500  The download time is faster when using a USB Memory Card Reader  The picture resolution from this camera is great  Before I bought this camera  I did a lot of comparison shopping  For the price  this little camera s pictures have surpassed some of the higher priced cameras Another thing that sold me on this camera was the fact the there is a cover that slides over the camera lens  I like that protection  But be care when handling the camera  Try not to put your finger prints on the 1 8 LCD screen  There are kind of hard to remove The tripod mount is in a funny place  It is not in the dead center of the bottom of the camera  It is on the bottom  off to on side  and near the front of the camera All in all this is a great camera for the first time digital camera user     
Auto, When I look at this ride  I can t call it a car  I feel like he s saying to me that he will take every challenge  It looks like nothing but power and guts  The nose alone  wow  some extra holes in it and a large wide open spread mouth give it an eager appearance  The back also looks quite impressive with its 4 huge exhaust pipes and the subtle  fine  waves  in the coach work turns it into a beauty for sure Of course this powerful look has to be supported by superior technique  This was also taken care of  the 5 6 litre along with some other adjustments provide an increase of capacity from 300 to a heavy 380 hp And with a sprint to 100 km h in 6 seconds and a peak of 250 km h this beautiful monster is definitely one of the fastest boys of the class  This however still doesn t make it into a sports wagon  therefore he s way to big The immense engine room is not only embellished by a splendid V12  but also through various advanced electronic systems It has a traction control system which recalls the clutch if a wheel would run on  One push on the button of the EML  right next to the six gear box  makes the V12 react totally different to the accelerator  Everything is a bit more supple  This ables the pilot to dose the power even more accurately  Ideal for start stop traffic It s just not suitable to pull up with almost spinning wheels because you accidentally pushed the pedal a bit too far  Because with so much horse power the difference between fast and very  very fast is a fraction of a millimeter Another advantage is the fuel compensation is a bit more within the limits  But if you can afford this ride it shouldn t count A special structure takes care of a pleasurable behavior in the turns because the back wheels steer along with the rest Naturally you will find all kind off luxuries in this expensive ride  This model has beautiful leather interior of sport seats  And because the back seat offers almost no room for the legs  you can put it down to transport even more luggage  A rare practical detail for this type of ride All in  you should definitely ride once in this one  
Camera, Wanted to  quot add a little interest quot  to my e mails  Realized how much I enjoy getting photos from my friends  who are scattered across this country and Europe  Wanted to be able to send an occasional photo  too Since I had no  quot professional quot  interest in a digital  went for  quot cheapest quot  I could get with a 640x480 resolution  I also wanted a flash  and removable memory  didn t want to worry about having to  quot trash quot  pictures before I was ready Bought it  tried it  sent a picture to my computer at work and ended up having to get 2 more cameras for my coworker  The clarity of the picture was that good No problems using the camera itself or uploading to the computer  Had a few problems with using the software  not a lot of instructions came with the camera  Otherwise  I am very pleased and not out a lot of money     
Auto, After a lot of lengthy research I ended up chosing the Flame Red Durango that I now drive  And to be honest with you I don t regret one bit of it I have purchased new vehicles in the past and have always had one or two complaints and actually have regretted the purchase  With my Durango I fall in love all over a again every day I drive it to work It handles like a dream and has ample ammounts of power to tow almost anything  It has a very smooth ride even when you are off the pavement  Excellent control in adverse conditions such as snow and ice  I enjoy the options in the 4 Wheel drive as well  This allows me to  quot dial in quot  my needed traction control  I opted for the 5 9L so I was able to tow a boat or snowmobiles  Believe me this thing has power  I owned a 5 0 95 Mustang prior to this SUV and I am not missing out on any power at all I think one of the best features of the Durango is its interior  Extremely roomy and actually quite luxurious  I opted for leather seating  The comfort of the ride is superb  I do travel long distances often and my body never really gets fatigued in my Durango like it does in my moms Explorer  I have noticed how much better things are built in the Durango V S  the Explorer  all the way down to the door handles  i would have to say Dodge did not leave any stone unturned when they put the Durango out on the market  It is rough and rugged enough to go offroad and handle adverse weather  yet very sleek and elegant enough to take you to your favourite Opera Not only does the Durango look good  it is so durable  I have been rear ended count this  quot 3 quot  times within the year I have owned my Durango  Not once have I had to take it in for any body work though  I can t say that about the cars that have hit me  for instance the little Maxima that hit me looks as though she wrapped her front bumper around a telephone pole  Needless to say I feel very safe in my Durango and have no problems with hauling my family around in it Overall I have to say that the Durango is certainly more bang for your buck  You look at all the other SUV s on the market and none can compare with the Durango as far as options and price is concerned  Not to mention overall power and performance  And to top it all off  you look good driving it br br  
Camera, MY HISTORY I blindly purchased my first digital camera  a Kodak  four years ago by ordering one off the internet because my rural town didn t have any digital cameras in stock  I choose the Kodak DC 240 1 3 MP camera  I was thrilled with it  When I showed people my photos  they raved they looked like magazine photos  I thought I was a good photographer   amazingly though   it wasn t me   it was all Kodak  Now  having tried many other cameras   I know I was blessed when I blindly chose Kodak for many reasons In my pursuit to buy a new camera  I blindly sent away for another Kodak  except this time I got a bomb  I bought the DX3900  and it was so bad   I immediately put it up for auction on e bay  I was so disappointed I can t even begin to say  Next I bought the latest and greatest Nikon 5000 camera  I set it up to  point and shoot  and WHOA I was so disappointed  Mind you this is a top of the line SLR 5MP camera with an 8X optical zoom   but it just didn t take quality photos in point and shoot mode  The shutter lag was INSANE  I often missed my subjects it was sooo slow  The lens hunted around in blur mode half the time  I couldn t take it  My old Kodak was QUICK  For the money  1100  I felt robbed  I quickly returned it Next  I bought the Minolta S404  I tried it out at Target and thankfully  the shutter lag was more tolerable and the hunting mode   while still present   wasn t quite as bad as the Nikon  I figured it was less complex and might be able to meet my needs  I bought it and took it home  Sadly  all the photos were dark  There was no software worth speaking about either with the Minolta  They seemed to have taken shortcuts compared to Kodak  I was paying more and getting less  None of the photos looked like the magazine photos I used to know with my Kodak  The color was pathetic   even after using their software to improve it  Upon reviewing photos at several sites like www imaging resources   I realized the Minotla was a flawed camera too  It didn t hold a candle to my old Kodak  I immediately returned it THE KODAK DX4330 Ahh and then I saw the newest camera come out by Kodak on Kodak s site and I had to try it  I ran out to Circuit City and tried it  The shutter lag and auto focus hunting are my biggest complaint with most cameras  They are sooooo slow  When I tried the new Kodak DX4330   WOW   it was great   like my old DC240  I purchased it and took it home  I was reserved but excited I quickly unwrapped it  and snapped a few photos  I never even opened up the manual and I quickly and intuitively figured out how to download the photos via the USB cable provided  This camera is great for anyone   the learning curve is zero  The first pictures were SIMPLY AMAZING  SMASHINGLY beautiful and as my first friend who saw the first photo said   They look like magazine photos  Yes  Kodak did it again I am not going to spend time reviewing the features of the camera  You can do that by clicking on the  Specs  or by going to the manufacturers page  I will tell you this is a 3 1 MP camera with little manual override features that competes with the best of them in quality  color and accuracy  You can blow up photos to 11x14 with incredible quality I can take sunsets and get fabulous color  which the Minolta could not do no matter what the setting  I can get great night shots outside with the porch light on and I can take great photos indoors or outside  again the Minolta failed on the indoor shots  You can also take fabulous macro shots   again this camera beat the Minolta hands down  I didn t test the Nikon on this The color is nearly perfect as well  again Minolta couldn t capture cherry red  Take a photo and compare it to reality   you ll be impressed  Kodak also supplies some great software with it too which allows you to crop  color adjust  covert to black n white  balance light dark  enhance  eliminate red eye  etc  The software is slick   quick and easy The camera is small  very light weight and the 2 AA batteries last for 180   shots using the flash and the review mode to see photos after they are taken  The storage media is Secure Digital so far  no complaints about that either The date stamp isn t the greatest as it is rather large and bright yellow   but it is there if you want it  There is no time stamp The software which comes with the camera is pleasing  It serves all my needs though I don t like the way Kodak makes you save photos to e mail people  I use another software to downsize the images  You also can t rename them using Kodak s software which is a flaw   but minor to live with  When you save photos to your hard drive  Kodak automatically files them in a folder with the date  You can override this and create your own naming conventions The downloading via the USB is amazingly quick and very simple  You can t mess it up  It s all intuitive  You can see a little thumbnail of each photo being downloaded which is great  Then when they are all downloaded  Kodak s software lets you view the photos in full screen slideshow mode I recently blew up the  first photo  I took with this camera as it was that pleasing   to an 11 x 14   and it looks professional the quality that is good This is a must buy  If you are thinking about it   don t  Get one today  You won t regret it if you are a novice or anyone who doesn t want to bother with all the old 35mm pre sets  The camera can easily fit into a purse and off you go to shoot  I average about 400 photos a week now  There is some blue casting on brightly lit shots   its the only negative I have seen   but compared to what I saw in other cameras   I ll gladly keep it Happy Camera Hunting  
Camera, Been using the Canon Digital Elph S100 Powershot after having used the Sony Mavica family of cameras as well as the Kodak DC 280 and 3400  I have to Say that the Canon S100 is by far the best  For all the same features  you get with the other cameras  you get so much more with The Canon  It s got a small form factor that really makes it so convenient to carry around  That s the huge advantage with this camera  Who wants to lug around their beastly Sony Mavica around after using this It s easy to set up  and the picture quality is fantastic  You can t beat that  My only gripes  Canon doesn t include a spare battery  the stock Compact Flash card is ONLY 8 MB  and there is no case included  Kinda cheap for a camera that is really nice The PowerShot S100 features an elegant  stainless steel  SUS316  body equipped with a number of advanced camera features including a 35 70mm  35mm equivalent  f 2 8 4 0 all glass aspherical lens to help minimize image distortion  A 4x digital converter extends the zoom range of the lens to 8x when used in conjunction with its 2x optical zoom capabilities  In addition  the camera is equipped with a three point AiAF autofocus system that permits the camera to automatically select the primary subject  even if the subject is off center  To further simplify overall operation  the Digital ELPH displays most camera settings on the LCD monitor  While using the control buttons at the base of the monitor  users can confirm desired camera functions identified on the LCD monitor with easy to understand icons or minimal text The Digital ELPH features a 0 37 inch  2 1 megapixel CCD sensor that creates full color or black and white images up to 1600x1200 pixels when set to the camera s Large resolution mode  The camera also offers an additional resolution setting of 640 x 480 when set in the Small mode  which is ideal for on screen applications  such as Web sites and CD ROMs and allows more images to be recorded on a single CompactFlash memory card  The new camera is compatible with Type I CompactFlash Cards and will be shipped with an 8MB CF card In order to maximize the capabilities of the 2 1 megapixel CCD  the PowerShot S100 is equipped with a dedicated digital signal processing integrated circuit  IC  to achieve high speed and complete processing of image detail  All images are recorded as JPEG files and a built in buffer memory allows continuous burst mode shooting of up to 2 frames per second when set to its maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200  The interval between shots in single frame mode is only 1 7 seconds  In addition  basic operations such as camera start up  high speed search mode during playback  image enlargement and image scrolling can now be executed swiftly  due to the digital signal processing IC s high speed compression and decompression operations I got mine from Outpost com because they had free shipping and NO tax  Yay  Also  if you shop through Ebates  you get another 5  back   you can use them FREE to shop at many other stores for up to 25  back http www ebates com index jsp referrer kenfused yahoo com 
Auto, I have already written a review on a  86 Mazda B2200 Cab Plus  but now it s time to write about the truck that replaced my fathers old truck  B2200  and bestowed it upon me We needed to get another vehicle since I was an up and coming driver  so my dad very pleased with his old mazda  bought a  89 B2000 with 105k on it  I asked if he thought that was a lot  but he quickly denied it for it was a Mazda  those things run forever  he said  And he was right He bought a  89 B2000 that was BONE STOCK  The guy who bought it new didn t even get a radio in it  that s how stock it was  No matter  though  Mazda isn t really renowned for it s superior audio  in trucks  anyways  It had the 4 cyl  5 spd  like every other Mazda out there  and it ran great  Still does Last Summer  we had severe flooding and thunderstorms in our area  Central PA  and my dad had to make an emergency trip to work  because the storm took out some transformers  or something  and since my Dad is an electrician at a large factory  he was called in  On the way there  there was LOTS of flooding  most of it in places you wouldn t expect  The little Mazda got into water up to the hood  and my dad quickly evacuated  waiting on a nearby porch for the water to recede  It did  and my dad climbed in his Mazda Submarine  and drove away  Of course it was driving like a pile of junk  water got in the oil  but a quick change of oil  and it was back to new  Except for the water lines inside the cab  and lot s of junk stuck in strange places  It s still up and running strong a year later  No major repairs other than exhaust  and brakes  Great truck  I wish I still had mine  Any vehicle that survives a flood with flying colors deserves to be in everyone s garage br br  
Camera, The Sony DSC P20 was my second digital camera  I ve used it for six months  The Camera itself is relatively small  not too small and not oversized like low end Kodak or HP models  At first glance  the camera looks to be another great quality product from Sony  After you use it and look at the picture quality it s a different story  Here are the Details THE SPECS The DSC P20 is a 1 3 Megapixel Camera  It takes pictures at 1280x960 maximum resoultion  It also has 512x384  640x480  and 1024x768 resolutions  The features include a count down timer  red eye reudction  integrated flash  1 5  color LCD screen  and viewfinder  The DSC P20 uses Sony s popular Memory Stick format  which currently sells from 2MB to 128MB sticks  The camera is made of durable plastic  and uses a USB connection to link to the PC  The Camera also uses 2 AA batteries or the optional Sony NPFS11 InfoLithium ION batteries  Not Included  If you decide to use regular AA batteries the Battery life is only 20   30 minutes total or about 12 shots with the Flash  some people have reported even less  I was using 2 AA NiMH 1800mAH batteries and they lasted about 1 hour total  Using the NPFS11 Lithium Ion will last you 2 5 hours  The DSC P20 comes with 3X Digital Zoom and no Optical Zoom  I found the images to be slightly degraded when I used the Zoom up to 3X but its hardly noticiable  The camera also comes with different picture effects such as Black White  Solarize  Sepia  and Negative modes  The camera saves images as  TIFF  JPEG  or GIF  It also takes MPEG movies  no sound  at 320x240 or 160x120  The camera also has a  MACRO  feature which will sharpen and focus in on images that are 3 feet or closer  The Sony DSC P20 is loaded with features THE PACKAGE There are not many accessories that are included with the DSC P20  Included in the box are  2 Sony AA batteries  wont last you very long  Camera Wrist Strap  The most useful item included in the box  and a 4MB Sony Memory Stick  Only lets you store 6   10 JPEG Full size shots at full resolution  Also included are the manuals and Software Drivers CD ROM  and USB Transfer cable  I suggest that you either go purchase some good 1800mAH NiMH rechargable batteries because Alkaline batteries will not last very long  This camera has extremly low battery life  Or If you are rich  you can buy the NPFS11 InfoLithium Battery for  89 99 CAD or  60 00 USD  Also you might also want to get a 32MB or higher Memory Stick  I had a 64MB Memory Stick which stored 118 JPEGS shots at full quality and higest resolution  or 36 TIFF uncompressed shots  or 11 minutes of MPEG Video  The package does not include a Camera bag  which I recommend if you want to carry the camera around often  Also Not included is the Optional AC Adapter for the Camera  Optional Accessory Packages like the Sony ACCCSPW for DSC P20  DSC P30  and DSC P50  includes the NPFS11 battery pack  Carrying Case and AC Adapter Charger  The Accessory Package is around  75 00 USD or  145 00 CAD THE PROS IN DETAIL The Sony DSC P20 is relatively cheap compared to other Sony Digital Cameras  You can probably get it for even cheaper than  200US since it is a 2001 model  Also This camera acts as a Memory Stick Drive  This is an excellent feature  You can transfer any kind of files to and from your memory stick like a removable hard drive  Also this camera is very easy to use  I didnt even need to read the manual and I figured out all the features etc THE CONS IN DETAIL The biggest Con about this camera is the picture quality  The picture quality is not as good as it should be  and it is absolutely horrible in low light conditions  The pictures are usually fine in outdoor light  however indoor light may have undesirable results such as  slight discoloration  and sometimes grainy pixels  In low light conditions the camera is especially bad  because the integrated flash is relatively weak  Also the red eye reduction will not work properly sometimes  The DSC P20 s LCD Screen scratches quite easily  and needs a camera bag if you are likely to get it scratched  Another major CON is obviously the battery life using standard AA batteries  This camera has the worst battery life I have ever seen  I used up the 2 AA batteries that were included in the box in 15minutes  I was only testing all the features and playing with the camera when I got a low battery warning Do I still own this Camera  NO If you want a Sony Digital Camera I would suggest a newer more mid level Sony Camera  It ll be more expensive but it will be worth it If you want a excellent quality low cost Digital Camera  check out the Canon A30 or A40 both are loaded with features and excellent picture quality  See my review on the Canon A30  The camera I m using now  
Camera, I ve had my Epson PhotoPC 700 for some time now and can t remember what it was like not to have it  Probably one of the best investments I have ever made  Not only do I never have to wait for film to be developed  but I can also view my pictures right away thus deciding if I want to keep a particular photo or not This camera came with a battery charger and the ability to add photo cards for even more storage  The camera itself holds 50 pictures in it s standard mode  Add to that the option of purchasing a thin little card that just slides into a slot and you can have up to 200 more pictures  Not once having to wait to change film The convience of being able to load the pictures onto my PC makes it that much more appealing  Add a photo printer to your system and you never have to go to a photolab again  However  if you aren t able to print out your own photo s you can still take the photo to a lab and have them turn it into a hardcopy for you Some of the options include an amazing zoom  I can zoom in up to 3x on any given item  There is a built in timer for taking pictures as well as special features for taking close shots that show a lot of detail  One of my favorite features is the ability to take black and white pictures with just the push of a button  There is no need to carry more then one camera  This camera can switch from standard pictures to speciality pictures with just the click of a few buttons The pictures are much more clear with a digital camera  You can even catch individual snowflakes as they fall  Have you ever tried to take pictures of fireworks with a regular camera  I have and they never turn out  This digital camera picked them up perfectly  I would defanitely be lost without it Though it is a bit pricey  it is well worth the extra money  The first week I had the camera it paid for itself just in the amount of film and cost for developing it would have cost  The best part was that I only ended up with pictures I wanted  No more wasting film on shots that just didn t turn out     
Camera, In the quest to provide learning experiences for my students  I was introduced to the Sony Mavica line of digital cameras  In case you are not up on the latest news regarding the state of public education  there is little money in the budget for this sort of tool  However  because I often use the technology of the computer and presentation software in my classroom  this item became a must have  I purchased the FD 83 for my personal use  but  like many other teachers  I use it in the classroom  It is very simple to use  It has great portability  and due to the media it uses to capture images   a standard 3 5 floppy disk  it is a resource that can be utilized by several students during a class period  My students used both the still image function as well as the MPEG function to create a community service project aimed at helping students new to middle school adjust  The kids quickly figured out which pictures they could take and immediately put to use  The bonus that the Mavica offered was that a disk could be ejected and the camera was immediately ready for another student to use  in addition the images captured on disk by the first student were ready as well   Gone are the days of downloads that take longer than the research for a paper of project  The PC mode disks posed no problem for our Apple computers and GraphiConverter  The videos transferred well and responded well as a facet of a presentation piece using Hyperstudio  The camera also offers several filters with which one can alter pictures while still in the camera  If one is dissatisfied with the filters  sepia and black and white are two of them  one can remove them  The black and white option came in quite handy when putting parts of a presentation on paper to be photocopied  The disk copy tool is invaluable when one wants to be sure that the pictures are in more than one place  With this option one can copy from one image to the entire disk of images in less than two minutes  and without any extra equipment  This eliminated the  quot my partner is absent quot  dilemma which many teachers face in group work  The floppy media also saved a great deal of class time as I did not need to download a memory card as I once did  Each floppy disk holds up to 40 images using the standard resolution  a bonus when working with students  however  this number drops drastically when the resolution is fine  A floppy only retains 7 fine resolution images  The MPEG function will record up to one minute of video and that uses all of the space on the floppy  I have found that one can override the 5  10  and 15 second preset times for video capture  If one simply continues to depress the operating button past the preset time  the camera will continue to record  up to 60 continuous seconds The resolution is more than adequate for the images that my students take  and it is often quite good  belying its low pixel ratio     
Auto, With GM s recent announcement of their decision to discontinue the Camaro Firebird  that leaves on classic ponycar still in production today  The Ford Mustang The Ford Mustang is an American ponycar icon that still sells quite well in today s generation  During a recent test drive  I was able to experience first hand what driving a Mustang is all about EXTERIOR The Mustang is designed with classic muscle car looks  The large front grill with the classic pony suggests a mean  get out of my way attitude  The whole car s design is a real headturner in my opinion  I especially like the rear deck and tailight design which is the view most drivers had on the road while I drove this mustang  My mustang was painted performance red which looks outstanding on this car  INTERIOR Thus mustang s interior is fairly simply laid out  The instrument panel is very cleanly designed and easy to read  The optional Mach 460 sound system rocks for a factory installed system  Interior room is just average though  and quite tight in the rear seats  but this is a sports car  and thats expected  I think Ford could have done a better job on the seats  Since the mustang is a performance car  and most people will drive it hard  it could use better side bolstering to keep the driver in place while manuvering through traffic  Noise insulation is not great  but once again this is a sports car and that is expected ENGINE RIDE I drove a mustang GT equiped with ford s growly and powerful 4 6 V8  Horsepower is a very impressive 260 and the overwhelming power pushed me into my seat while accelerating hard from stoplights  The mustang s V8 makes a pleasent exhaust growl which is a true musclecar feature  The auto transmission mustang I drove had more than adequate power throughout the rev range  however  I think a manual would be more fun  The mustang s ride quality is just average  due to the tuned suspension which is designed for spirited driving  VALUE The mustang GT retails for anywhere between  21 000 24 000 depending on the level of equipment and options you select  This is one of the best  bang for your buck  vehicles on the market today  However the Mustang is very expensive to insure and previous Mustang s have had some repair issues and Ford doesn t have the greatest build quality reputation as with most domestic automakers  I would buy the mustang someday as a second car to drive on weekends  but wouldn t recommend it as an everyday car  Sports cars in general are not comfortable or practical to drive in everyday situations  But if you want a car that will get to where you need to go in very quickly with a lot of style and tradition  without breaking the bank  consider the Ford Mustang  
Camera, Comparison  I compared five 5M cameras before settling on the Nikon 5400  Film wise I ve dabbled with photography for quite a while  starting with an Olympus XA1  and I ve had a Canon EOS 1000F SLR for 12 years  I bought an Olympus D 540L some time ago  which is 0 75M camera  It s taken some nice pics but as you re probably aware these won t print out at more than 3  x 2  Since film photography is expensive and frustrating if you don t have your own development equipment  digital photography is the way to go  My opinion is you need a 4 5M camera to replace a 35mm camera  Full manual override is a must as well The cameras I looked at    Canon G5   Sony V1   Olympus C5050   Nikon 5700   Nikon 5400 A good way to compare features is to go to http www dpreview com  the  Buying guide  menu and choose  Side by side  A lot of the features are similar and it s pretty close these days between the manufacturers  Visual quality of the cameras is improving at a marked rate and it s difficult to choose between them here  The cameras do have certain features that have pros and cons and this is where you draw your final conclusion  Here is my summary of the 5 cameras listed above    Canon G5   When you hold this in the shop next to the 5400 and V1 it feels like a brick  It is large and bulky  but all the features are easily accessible and it doesn t feel fiddly  Personally I think this has the worst artifacts out of all the cameras listed above  Colour balance and tone are great but if you look at the resolution test  on comparion  you ll see that diagonals are aliased and there are slight green fringes to black edges  Conclusion  I decided against this camera because of its size and artifacts    Sony V1   This is the most compact of the above cameras and for has the massive plus of a Carl Zeiss lens  I used to have an Olympus XA1  which was a compact point and click 35mm camera  which also had a Carl Zeiss lens  I think it took some of the best pictures I ve ever taken  Looking at the results on this site  this camera takes excellent pictures and Sony seem to have sorted out the colour balancing on this model  It is nice and compact and has an automatic lens cover which is a nice feature  It s size is both a plus and a minus though  If you have large hands I don t think you ll like this camera  it is not easy to hold  It has some interesting features  like you can take pictures in complete darkness using it s infra red mode  It will also focus perfectly in the dark  Compared to the other cameras is is quite cheap  but then you have to use more expensive Sony memory cards and you have to buy Sony attachements  e g  external flash  This is the only camera which doesn t have moveable screen   and you ll wish you did have one once you ve had a camera that has this feature  Conclusion  I decided against this camera because it was so awkward to hold in the shop and the menus seemed a bit fiddly to select option settings  Also it doesn t have a moveable viewing screen and you must buy Sony accessories    Olympus C5050   This camera is the oldest of the ones above I believe  I ve been quite impressed with my old Olympus 540L  Despite it s low resolution and age I think it take pretty good pictures  I think Olympus are a little underrated personally as Sony  Nikon and Canon seem to get all the attention  This camera is supposed to be very good in low light  and I like twilight photography so I did consider this camera  It feels good in your hand taking photos and the image quality is excellent  just look at the comparions  Conclusion  I decided against this model as it s been out quite a while and I think the imaging software has moved on since then  It moves at a very rapid pace  The reviews point out some arifacts and I d rather not have those  despite getting at Recommended rating    Nikon 5700   This camera gets good reviews  it feels nice to hold  it has good functionality and takes excellent photos  It has an 8x optical zoom  which is fantastic  but because of this the camera feels more like an SLR as it larger than the others  This camera is more expensive than the others but has all their features and the zoom  Conclusion  If you want a camera with big zoom  I d look at some of the cheaper Olympus models  There s an old maxim in photography  if you want to zoom in on a subject move closer to it  If you get a big zoom and you don t have good light you re just going to get camera shake  You even start to notice it on some of the 3x and 4x zoom models  This is a great camera  but just not quite what I was looking for    Nikon 5400   I think this has the same body as the 5700 but with a 28 116mm equivalent lens  When I had my Canon EOS 1000F  it came with a 35 80mm lens  I soon changed this for a 28 70mm lens because more often than not you use wide angle than zoom  When you do need zoom 3 or 4 times is plenty  You rarely need 8x or 10x optical zoom and when you do you can sacrifice a little quality and do it digitally  So as you can probably tell this sold the camera to me  Other than that  the camera feel great to hold  has a good rubber grip  and you can practically operate it with one hand  The fold out screen is excellent and allows you to lift it up high  or down on the ground and still see what you are taking  Conclusion  Wide angle lens with 4x zoom  good to hold and excellent images  I will say this camera is a little slow to process you photos once taken and isn t great at focussing in  really  bad light Summary Well  I hope this information has been useful to you  This is the kind of review I was looking for when trying to decide what to purchase  If you are budding photo enthusiast and you take a lot of photos and like to experiment with your camera I would avoid the Sony as it s very fiddly   just try it in a shop  It also has no fold out screen  which also means it could get scratched as it has a soft plastic cover  I take it this is the main difference why this camera is cheaper  All the other cameras are much nicer to handle although the 5700 is larger  I like to go out on my bike and take photos and the 5700 won t fit in a  large jacket waterproof  pocket whereas the others will  The Olympus C5050 and Canon G5 probably take the worst photos of the 5 due to noise and aliasing in the images  The Nikons are more expensive but feel like good solid camera and have all the features you ll ever need  The Nikon cameras are the most expensive  but you can get good comparative deals if you shop around  You ll read in a number of reviews that the 5400 low light focus is a little sketchy   although it has to be pretty low light  The thing that sells it is the wide angle  Go out and takes some panorama shots with it  or interiors and you ll be sold My impressions of using the Nikon 5400  I m very happy with the pictures from my 5400  granted it s a BIG leap up from the Olympus model I had before  I m having great fun with time lapse photography  and shutter priority  metering is excellent on this camera  I ve had it a couple of weeks now and taken 1000 pictures and I still feel I m only scratching the surface of all the features  Definitely get a 256Mb card if you get one of these cameras  don t frustrate yourself with anything less Copying 256Mb onto a PC takes about 5 10 mins over USB  I think you can get flash readers which might be faster than this  It s still not a long time though considering the amount of data  My 540L would take 20 mins to do 16Mb over the serial link You can pretty much work the 5400 with one hand  The dials are excellent and I wouldn t buy a camera that doesn t have dial mode selector after having my Canon EOS 1000F  I found the rear mounted cursor buttons too low  The rear controls should be further up the camera to be more comfortable with the buttons in an arc around the cursor  following the sweep of your thumb  The rubber grip is good though and it s comfortable to take lots of photos The fold out screen is a big plus  although a little small  I take it you have to compromise in order to have better battery life  If you are using the camera a lot in one day it ll be lucky to see the day out so you should invest in a second battery  These take 2 hours to fully charge with the charger provided Software that comes with the camera is pretty good  The Nikon view camera software is fully featured and scaleable  will work comfortably whatever the power of your PC  You can do just about anything to a photo with the Photoshop Elements package that it comes with  That s real fun and why digital photography is definitely the future  I have an HP5550 photo printer which gives great results as well  note  get a printer which prints full page as the 5550 has a white border  For best results you should go to a professional printers where they ll have 20 grand professional printer   you get better results Enjoy Nick 
Camera, My wife is an avid 35mm camera buff and is still not sold on digital photography  Well I came across a good deal on a Polaroid PDC 1300 camera and despite some shortcomings  I am quite impressed of what you get for the price First of all  Windows XP users may be a bit frustrated  The camera will not work with the simple and easy to use  built in  digital camera software that works so well with scanners and other input devices  So  you have to install the Polaroid software though a compatibility wizard  It installs but I was unable to use the USB cord  so I had to go with the much slower  seems like it  serial plug  A good solution would be to spend a little extra money and get a universal CompactFlash reader that works like a disk device in Windows XP  Makes it much easier Now  on to the camera  It takes really good pictures  They are clear and crisp at all resolutions  The only bad picture I had was when I was taking pictures outside at dusk  They seemed to be quite dull  There isn t an adequate zoom on the camera  so you really have to move in to fill the frame  The LCD screen and the menu options work quite well and are an added bonus for the low cost to the camera  The included software is pretty basic but if basic is what you want  XP s software is much easier and faster to use  Windows 95 98 ME users will have no problems installing the software The camera consumes the batteries quite quickly  so be sure to turn it off when not in use  The LCD screen also eats a lot of power  When the batteries are low  there really is no warning and when you go to take a picture  it will flash and then turn off  I would recommend taking a pocketful of batteries with you on trips  It also includes a USB and Serial cord  a protective case and an 8 Meg card  I would recommend getting at least a 32 meg card  Overall  if you can find this camera for under  200 00  it is a great price and very good for basic use  Those wanting more features are better off with one with more  bells and whistles  
Camera, Bristling with buttons  knobs  and dials  the new 5 2 megapixel Minolta Dimage 7 has a large  2 3 inch CCD and carries the highest optical resolution of any consumer digicam on the market today  So who needs it  Any 3 megapixel camera at half the price lets you print photos at 8x10 inches or bigger  The question is do you really need this much power  The answer is yes if you want to blow up selected parts of your pictures without losing a significant amount of image quality  That s the main advantage of this silver and charcoal beauty  whose mix of metal and plastic gives it a high tech  professional look  But the Dimage 7 has some annoying quirks  For one  the Dimage 7 that I have frequently gave low battery warnings  and it stopped operating after only a few pictures had been taken  the battery compartment had to be opened and the four AA batteries jiggled until proper contact was re established  It also ran hot  After a dozen consecutive shots  the grip became uncomfortably warm for the thumb to rest upon  But regardless of heat  the Dimage 7 captured pictures that looked dull unless they were first run through Minolta s Image Viewer software  a needlessly time consuming extra step  My family found the images to be adequate and detailed but not quite up to par with those of other cheaper cameras Even more annoying is that images on the electronic viewfinder  similar to those found on camcorders  are grainy  flickering  and lacking in detail it s not a true through the lens viewfinder  Rather  it just poorly mimics the 1 8 inch LCD monitor  which works well enough on its own  Finally  pictures taken in low light situations were consistently overexposed in the autoexposure mode until the compensation was adjusted to Minus One  Despite these shortcomings  the Dimage 7 has many excellent features  including great documentation and easy operation  Those intimidating looking buttons and dials actually put most of the controls at your fingertips instead of requiring a deep dive into a sea of menus  The Aperture and Shutter Priority modes are a simple click press and set operation  as are the White Balance  ISO  up to 800  resolution  and compression modes  Even the manual focus requires a simple push of a button push  then a turn of the ring at the base of the lens  and it s quick and accurate  A dedicated button lets you quickly revert to the camera s automatic program mode without fumbling around  The 7X optical zoom range  an excellent 28mm to 200mm equivalent  works by rotating an easy to grip rubberized ring  The shutter speeds are generous from 4 seconds to 1 2 000 of a second and a Bulb setting allows exposures up to 30 seconds for night scenes or special effects  There are also 49mm threads on the lens that extend the Dimage 7 s versatility by allowing you to add filters and auxiliary lenses  Minolta s f 2 8 lens is more than up to the task of producing crisp  colorful  big images 13x17 inch prints were no sweat on an Epson Stylus Photo 1200  Since you ll be taking beefy 2MB images  on average  it s good that the memory card slot accepts CompactFlash Type I and II cards including the IBM Microdrive  However  you ll need some heavy duty memory because the bundled 16MB card is incredibly inadequate  It may be burdened with a  1 500 list price  but Minolta is off to a good start with the Dimage 7  If you re looking for megaresolution in an easy to use  feature rich digicam  nothing else comes close  However  if pixel count isn t your focus  the Olympus C 3040 Zoom will cost you half as much and still provide quality 3 megapixel images  This camera just costs too much  
Auto, I bought the 2000 Toyota Corolla VE model in November 1999  I have two children ages 1 and 2 and to my surprise this car accomodates them well  I travelled with them twice from San Diego to Phoenix and never felt cramped  I bought the car because of its value and wonderful mechanical reputation  First oil change not recommended for 7500 miles  Excellent gas mileage  It drives like a larger sedan with a very smooth transmission  It is very easy to park and turn around  I would highly recommend anyone buy this car  Whether you are a college student or an Executive this a a great buy  I hope to have this car for many years to come br br  
Camera, The camera is so simple and easy to use  What a great way to get into a digital cameras  Other camera seemed to bulky and ugly looking  This camera is so fun to use and good looking we bought a second one  When shopping for a Digital Camera the selection was rather dim  Low end cameras had a attractive price  but very dismal picture quality  Picture quality was important to me since the primary use of this camera was for online Auctions and documenting college projects  But the cost of a high end camera was bank breaking  The Canon attracted us since we already own the regular film Canon Elph  The ultra compact size was a huge buying point  Other camera felt bulky and cumbersome  Use this camera and it feels like a regular point and shoot  Picture quality can be adjusted depending on your needs  I can usually get a good  rolls  worth of film on the stock flash cards  The camera has a very durable metal casing  the screen is small  but not too small  It feels perfect for the cameras mini size  This camera is so simple to use that i didn t even look at the instructions for a few weeks of constent use  If you can work a point and shoot camera  you can use this Canon with ease  The Canon comes with a handy little battery charger that is also small and compact  Negatives  well battery life is alittle bit on the short side  Reducing your battery consumption by turning of the LCD screen helps alot  The flash card they give you is far to small  A upgrade to 32 MB is well worth the extra money  Also invest in a Sandisk flashcard reader  It makes loading images on your computer very easy  Much easier then getting a bunch of wires and plugging in your computer  The compact size is nice when you carry it in your pocket  but remeber to watch out for those fingers  On occasion they do get in the way  Buy this camera  You won t feel ripped off because it feels well built  its easy to use   complete lack of instruction reading  its a pretty piece of metal  the pictures are great quality  and It has a good midrange pricing  I dont know why people would want anything else  
Camera, This is a good digital camera for someone wanting to get into digital photography  It s easy to use  The shape and feel of the camera is very much like a traditional non digital point and shoot As you might expect from Kodak  the images themselves are quite good The biggest downfall of this camera is that there s no optical zoom  The digital zoom is difficult to use  Since it s not optical  you have to use the display screen when shooting with it to see what you ll really get   you can t tell by using the viewfinder  This makes it quite difficult for outdoor shots where the screen can be tough to see  The camera will also go through the battery power more quickly when using the display screen  And even at only 3X the zoom makes the picture quite grainy and pixelated  so I pretty much gave up on using it and considered it to be a camera with no zoom The DX3600 is not much more  but it does have an optical zoom   not much  but enough to make it much more useful than the 3500  My suggestion if you get this camera is to not use the zoom  even if it looks like it would make a better shot  Instead  shoot without it  then crop the photo later on your PC  You ll avoid the pixelation problem  and if you shoot at the highest resolution  you ll still have a decent size photo  especially if it s for sharing via the web or e mail  but even small prints will be okay Also be aware that replacing the batteries can get expensive  I suggest purchasing a charger and rechargable battery pack  That does  of course  offset one of the nice benefits of this camera   the price I used this camera for a few weeks then sold it on Ebay and used the money for a DX3600  You can find both models regularly on Ebay as factory refurbs  although most were probably never even used    but don t get too carried away with the bidding  as I ve seen some of them go for almost the price of new ones  
Camera, The other reviews have covered this camera quite well so I would just like to add a little bit of my own insight  1  Bulk   The camera is a lot bulkier than most digitals  however I like the feel of a 35mm so this camera suites me well  If you want an easy to carry all around camera this is not it  However if you like the feel and heft of a traditional 35mm this camera might suite you too  2 The 2 5 inch LCD is awesome  My old 1 6 really stinks compared to this one  3  Disks can be interchanged at anytime  I buy a 10 pack of mini CD R s and initialize all of them at once  They only take a few seconds each and then I have storage for about 600 to 3000 photo s depending on your resolution setting  4 What s with tiff  I don t know of any online store that will except tiff files and they are enormous  They should switch to RAW if they want an uncompressed format on the camera  5 They don t really offer a wide array of lenses for the camera  just a few basics  For a serious amateur or pro this might be an issue  Also you need an adapter ring to use them  6  The battery can t be charged outside the camera   Unless you want to buy a special charger from Sony for around  60  If you want a spare you have to take out the one in the camera then insert the spare to charge it  Charging spare battery   Pain in A  7  Menu s are easy and logically laid out  It only takes a few minutes to master the menu s on this camera  Sony has done an excellent job in this department Otherwise I love the camera  it takes sharp clear images  and depending on the resolution setting it doesn t take that long to burn them to CD  This camera has a 4x CD drive  an 8x might be a nice improvement  Battery life is good considering you are powering a mini computer  Also I took a tip from another reviewer and bought some of those pda screen protectors  I cut it to fit over the LCD  works great  Protects the LCD and images are still crystal clear  
Auto, I already wrote my little review of the S2000 under the Acura NSX heading  but to recap A gt  I am not a car expert  and I can only judge this car based on having been lucky enough to convince a reviewer for a magazine that he should give me a test ride B gt  This car is fantastic looking  like a Miata on steroids  it has gorgeous  muscular lines and an impeccably finished interior  The one I saw was red and had people pulling off the road to ask what it was C gt  The engine ROCKS  Revving up to 9000 rpm  the motor sounds like a jet engine and has more power than the average fighter plane  The acceleration was insane  and the six speed transmission is really a joke  we never got anywhere near fifth  much less sixth D gt  My skepticism was on the handling  I have always preferred the handling of German cars  but the S2000 holds on to the road as well as any German import  We took a hairpin turn at 55mph in 1st gear  It completely blew me away DOWNSIDES  I am told that they are sold out through 2001  Also  this car is not for tall people  I have relatively long legs  though I am no giant  and my knees were hitting the wheel  It s a good thing all those hip young starts are short br br  
Camera, I ve owned a Fuji MX 700 for 18 months or so  and it is one of my all time favourite and most reliable digital toys  I use it for all sorts of things   both private and professional  Keeping friends and relatives around the world up to date on our young son s development is a snap when you can go straight from smartcard to hard drive   who needs a scanner  Professionally  I use the MX 700 to capture images to accompany features I write for New Zealand youth lifestyle magazine Pulp  We have found the images reproduce really well  considering their file size   high res  1MB  black and white images have even been used at full page  and looked great  Usually though  we use lo res images in a film strip fashion  using maybe 20 pics to illustrate a feature As far as ease of use goes  the MX 700 is tops  The vertical format suits even my left handed fumblings  and the controls are obvious  as are the on screen interface and mode LCD display  In this respect  it blows its supposed successor  the MX 1500  out of the water   We were unlucky enough to be convinced to buy one of these at work and have regretted it ever since If you re considering buying the MX 700  or its bigger lensed cousin  whatever that s called  may I suggest a couple of accessories  First  a bigger memory card   4MB at least  if the machine on offer doesn t ship with one  Don t put this purchase off  either   you ll almost always get a better deal on the card if you buy it at the same time as the camera  The other  quot must have quot  is an  quot Image Memory Card Reader quot  model SM R1 or equivalent  It plugs into the USB port on your iMac or similar and is like an external drive that uses memory cards instead of disks  It is 100 times faster and more convenient than feeding pictures into your computer down a wire Well  enough praise already  did I mention you can play your pictures from camera straight into your TV or VCR  Colourful  high res and lots of fun Buy this camera  or its direct descendants as they arrive  You will not be disappointed br br  
Auto, In 1998 I became pregnant with my son  and immediately started looking for a new car  At the time we owned a 1994 Geo Metro  still have it  and my husband and I both agreed that it was not adequate to transport a child in safely  So I started hunting for an affordable car suitable for the transportation of a family I looked within our price range  which topped out at around 15 thousand dollars  I rounded my choices down to three  Toyota Corolla  Chevrolet Prizm and the Chevrolet Cavalier Doing more research  I found out that the Chevy Prizm and the Toyota Corolla are made in the same factory in California  with the same dimensions and engine specifications  But the Corolla ranged from 1 to 2 thousand dollars more in price than the Prizm  So I cut out the Corolla  and I went to test drive the Cavalier and Prizm After test driving both vehicles  I ultimately decided on the Prizm  It was a smooth ride  easy to handle  quiet and peppy  While the Cavalier had style and almost a race car type feel  it didn t afford much room  and the two door model cost the same as the Prizm four door model I m a very picky car buyer  so I make the dealership bend over backwards to sell me a vehicle  I had them show me the engine  which had  in big bold letters across the block  quot TOYOTA quot  Lol  the kind of muffler  it s tire specs  etc etc  I was sold on the car  and bought it over the next two days That was back in August of 1998  The car is used mainly for mild travel about town with my son  who is now 13 months old  It gets great gas mileage  is still very comfortable and quiet  I bought a model with a manual transmission  and it is very easy to maneuver  and changes gears very smoothly  There is good head room for taller individuals  and all of the controls are easy to reach  The back seat is roomy  with three over the shoulder belts  There are also daytime running lights which I find very helpful  considering I live in a neighborhood heavily populated with children It s crash test ratings were some of the highest  right up there with Volvo  Subaru and Ford models equal to it s size class  My insurance premiums were lower with the Prizm than they would have been with the Cavalier  even though they are in the same price class I don t recommend the automatic transmission for this car  they are generally bad on gas and more prone to problems in the long run  not to mention that they add a couple of thousand dollars onto the base price of a car  I tested the automatic  and it was rough and loud compared to the manual Over all  this was a very good buy  It s easy to maintain  and the average fill up is around 12 dollars with regular unleaded gasoline br br  
Camera, The Casio Exilim EX S3 is the beginning of the new generation of digital cameras  Combining compact size and image capacity  this is the digital camera to get SIZE  The EX S3 is the first camera of its kind to be able to fit in a wallet  If you stack up 10 credit cards  you get the size of this camera  Whenever I am on the go  I just slip it into my back pocket and I 146m gone  It also doesn 146t have any attachments  which gives you even less to carry  The exact dimensions are 89 5mm W  x 57mm H  x 11 7mm D  The lens is 7 1mm  which is in proportion to a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera  To add on to the amazingly small and efficient size of the camera  it is also as light as a feather  The camera weighs 72 grams  This camera doesn 146t have all of the add ons that you can get with a regular camera such as a tripod or different lenses  This guitar just has the bare necessities  If you need all of the other attachments  get a different camera IMAGES All of the EX S3 146s come with a dock that plugs into the computer through a USB input  While in the dock  the camera can be charged  or photos can be imported onto the computer  Another thing that the EX S3 can do is take video  As you put your pictures onto the computer  they are saved as JPEG  DCF standard  or DPOF compliant  When you put your video on the computer  it is saved as AVI  Motion JPEG  There are many image sizes  in pixels  that you can have  Pictures can be 2 048 x 1 536  1 600 x 1 200  1 280 x 960 or  640 x 480  The movies can be 320 x 240  The maximum length of a movie is 30 seconds long  If you are bummed out about this and you want longer movies  then buy a camcorder  The camera has 3 2 megapixels  That equals 3 200 000 pixels  Did you every wonder why the picture on the screen was so grainy  That is because of the digital zoom  The camera can zoom in or out 4x without the lens moving  When you put the pictures on the computer  the graininess will be completely gone  The zoom though is nothing like an optical zoom  which works much better MEMORY One thing I like about the EX S3 is its memory  Even though it only comes with 10MB of built in memory  you can buy compact flash cards for it  Those can go from 32MB to a GIG  About 1000MB  There is a chart on Casio com where they show you how much space each type of picture can take up depending on resolution  and Image size  pixels  OTHER The EX S3 has 15 different recording modes  They are  1 Portrait 2 Scenery 3 Portrait With Scenery 4 Coupling Shot 5 Pre Shot 6 Pet 7 Flower 8 Natural Green 9 Sundown 10 Night Scene 11 Night Scene Portrait 12 Fireworks 13 Monochrome 14 Retro 15 Twilight  This camera also has built in flash  There are several flash modes you can have such as auto  flash on  flash off  or red eye reduction  There is also a timer so you can get into pictures that you took  You can make the timer countdown from 10 seconds or 2 seconds  The monitor on the camera is really nice  It is a 2 0 inch flat screen  TFT color LCD  and has 84 960 pixels  354 x 240 BUNDLES When you buy the camera  you get some accessories with it  but remember you only get the bare essentials  You get a Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery  NP 20  a USB Cradle  to put the camera in  a Special AC Adaptor  a Strap  a Special USB Cable  and a Dummy Card  You also get some software such as Photo Loader 2 1 for Windows  Photo Loader 1 1 for Macintosh  Photohands 1 0 for Windows  USB driver 1 0 for Windows  and USB driver 2 1 for Macintosh OVERALL My overall opinion on this camera is if you are looking for a small camera that you can just put in your pocket and go  this is the one  If you are looking for a digital camera for business use  don 146t get this one  Get a really good camera  I am not saying the EX S3 is a bad camera  I am just saying it is not something I would use for my job  Also  if you don 146t need all of the little parts and numerous accessories  get this camera because this camera comes with only the essentials  This is definitely a recreational camera  a good one too  
Camera, Having always been interested in Photography digital cameras had been on my wish list for some  Quality of pictures and price kept me from buying a digital until this year when so many advances have been made and the price dropped to where its affordable  I bought the Nikon Coolpix 950  It had most of the features I wanted but was still a trade off  No one digital camera has every feature  I narrowed it down to the Sony Mavica and the Nikon  The Sony s big advantage was the use of floppies for picture storage  The Nikon had Optical viewing an well as the lcd screen  The Coolpix has been a delight to work with after I learned all the features  Check that I m still learning after almost a year  It has more features than I ll use  In the auto mode  which is the mode I started in  its point and shoot  Gradually I learned to use some of the program modes with individual settings  The picture quality is excellent  I have been able to make excellent 8x10 s that are not distinguishable from good 35 mm s  Color rendition to my eyes appears very accurate br br  
Auto, I live in Central Mass where the weather in the winter has both ice and snow  My driveway below the road grade and is on a numbered road which is quite busy  and the snow plows create a slush bank 12 inches high  I also like to take a hilly back road to work in the morning I had traded in a 10 year old legacy wagon for this vehicle  There is no comparison even when the 91 was new  Of course bad weather handling  traction are great  I have made it up my driveway on a sheet of ice  and between the full time all wheel drive and the anti lock brakes I can go and  quot stop quot  as I want The car is very comfortable and deals with bumpy roads as if they were not there  The handling is very good and response is almost instantaneous There is enough power to cruise at 90 on the Mass Pike  Putting the back seat down has allowed me to fit a couch and a 6 foot bookcase in the car The only bad thing about the car is the rather annoying alarm system  which you must buy in order to get the remote  One button does on and off  Even if the car is unlocked you may have to push the alarm button Gas mileage is 23 mpg  Nothing has gone wrong with the car at all br br  
Camera, The   Fuji FinePix 2800 Zoom  is a digital camera with 2 1 Megapixel CCD  which allows you shoot up to 1600x1200 resolution  And  unlike some digital camcorders that supposedly produce this kind of resolution with lower resolution CCDs  this resolution is  real In other words  if you buy a digital camcorder that claims to produce 1600x1200 resolution from 1 3 Megapixel CCD  e g  Panasocic DV702  you cannot possibly get  real  1600x1200 resolution  1600x1200 resolution requires at least 1600x1200 b 1 920 000 pixels  b Real  Resolution and Zoom  The FinePix 2800 can produce  real  1600x1200 resolution and also features things like 6x optical and 2 5x digital zoom  It allows you also use 640x480 and 1280x960 resolutions b LCD  Viewfinder and Low Light Conditions  The camcorder has a 1 8  LCD and an electronic viewfinder  They are this camera s biggest drawback   both are barely visible in any kind of semi dark condition  which makes it impossible to see what you are shooting The LCD and viewfinder work fine with well illuminated scenes  but in low light conditions you cannot see anything on them  plus auto focus has issues in low light conditions  This camera is not for someone who wants to take pictures indoors  in medium to dark lighting b Picture Quality  The picture quality is excellent provided there is adequate light  There are no problems outdoors   with sunlight the picture quality is stunning  The camera is rated as ISO 100  so expect to use flash a lot and due to the above mentioned LCD and EVF problems as well as problems with auto focus in low light conditions  I have to once again mention that it is not the best choice for indoor shooting b Features  The camera also has no TIFF mode and the supplied SmartMedia card is only 16 Mb  The camera can shoot AVI movies  up to 60 seconds with sound at 10 fps at 320x240 resolution  with pretty good quality  but the built in microphone is not that great  The camera features USB connection  has flash  you will need it  macro capability and auto focus  You can control exposure manually  in addition to AE modes  and the camera is easy to use  in general  The pictures can include your voice annotations of up to 30 seconds per picture  There is an automatic white balance mode as well as six other white balance modes The shutter speed is controlled from   to 1 1 500 second  The aperture is F2 8  F4 8 or F8 2  The auto focus can work in Macro mode  from 3 9 inches to 2 6 feet  or regular mode  2 6 feet to infinity The built in flash has several settings you can use  Auto  Slow Sync  Red Eye Suppression  Forced Flash  The flash can reach 9 8 feet b Batteries  The camera uses AA size batteries  4 alkaline batteries are included  but consumes them quickly with LCD on and doesn t show the battery status until they are almost empty  I suggest  if you get this camera  that you get rechargeable Ni MH batteries and a charger   this last substantially longer that alkalines b What s Included  i Included are i Camera 16 Mb SmartMedia Card 4 Alkaline AA size Batteries USB Cable Manual CD ROM with USB drivers and software Shoulder strap and lens cap with strap b Bottom Line  i This camera is inexpensive and produces excellent picture quality in well lit conditions  But the low light performance is disappointing and the batteries are consumed quickly    
Auto, Mercedes Benz is a legendary name in the auto industry  renowned for its exceptional quality and engineering  but does that mean the three pointed star is immune to rolling out an occasional lemon  Is it possible for Mercedes Benz to build a clunker Yes Virginia  M B is indeed capable of building a clunker  We know because we own one  We leased a new 1999 ML 320 in October  1998 and were immediately surprised by some very un Mercedes like rattles  squeaks and shakes  The ML felt much looser than our other sport utility vehicle  a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee  This came as something of a shock  considering how often Mercedes is praised in the car magazines for its solid body structure and  vault like  feel After about a month  the rattles  squeaks and shakes were joined by a rushing wind noise from the rear hatch which grew steadily in intensity over the next few weeks until the interior of our vehicle at highway speeds sounded like a 747 blasting down the runway at full thrust  Another surprise awaited us at the car wash  where the rear cargo compartment got thoroughly soaked because of the poor seal around the hatch door  Good thing we weren t shlepping any groceries back there at the time  I don t have anything against wax beans  but I m not sure how tasty Carnuba d veggies might be When we took the ML to the dealer to look at the problem  the service manager pointed out that the hatch door was sticking up about an inch above the roofline   Has the vehicle been in a crash  he asked  adding that he had never seen such a badly misaligned door that wasn t the result of a collision  The dealer replaced the weather stripping around the hatch and realigned the door  which fixed the problem temporarily  The wind noise returned several months later  We were perplexed by the poor quality of our vehicle  but never having owned a Mercedes before  we didn t know if the rattling was something that plagued all MLs or just ours  Then we drove the dealer s ML 320 loaner while ours was in the shop for the first of what would be many  many extended visits  We were astounded that the loaner had none of the shakes and rattles of our own vehicle  displaying the kind of surefooted composure one would expect in a Mercedes  The difference was night and day  I should point out here that the loaner ML was the so called Elegance version  which includes leather upholstery  a sunroof and other amenities  while our ML is the less expensive  Classic version  with cloth seats and no sunroof  Mechanically however  the two versions are identical We subsequently drove yet another dealer owned ML 320 Elegance  which was also rattle free  Why then did our ML rattle and squeak like a bad accordion in an oompah band  We concluded that our vehicle somehow slipped off M B s new assembly line in Tuscaloosa  Alabama without anyone catching the defect  It happens  Any assembly line produces its share of defects and rejects  When you consider that M B was still working out the kinks in a brand new factory at the time our vehicle was built not to mention struggling to keep up with the surging demand for the M series it s not inconceivable that one shoddy specimen slipped through  But you will never get Mercedes Benz to admit that  A regional service manager sent to inspect our car concluded that the rattling was caused by defective door hinge hardware  which was replaced under warranty  The doors no longer rattle  but the rest of the body still does  The vehicle shudders violently when going over even modest potholes or bumps  The passenger side window now squeaks constantly and the dashboard shakes like Ricky Martin in La Vida Loca  Another problem has been with the  check engine  light  which stayed illuminated for about six months while the dealer tried  and failed  repeatedly  to fix the engine sensor problem that caused the light to go on in the first place  It was finally fixed after about four or five trips to the dealer   We almost miss the warm  amber glow of the  check engine  light that has been our constant driving companion all these months  Oh  and did I mention that one of the headlamps burned out after less than 40 000 kilometers  about 25 000 miles So naturally Mercedes Benz  keeper of the quality faith  immediately sent a team of experts to examine our vehicle in microscopic detail  in order to learn how such an aberration could possibly have passed out the factory gate  right  Um  no  The idea that Mercedes is somehow more genuinely concerned about quality than other corporations is a fantasy that we gullible folk in consumerland have been conditioned to believe by all the company s glossy advertising and careful cultivation of its brand cachet  The reality is that Mercedes Benz is an arrogant corporation that doesn t care any more about its customers than any other car company  which is to say it is happy to sell you a car  but if you have a problem  don t expect them to make it right  Of course  the special treat in dealing with Mercedes is that its employees have perfected the technique of looking down their noses at us hoi polloi arrivistes  who  now that the company has brought in reasonably priced vehicles  are able to join the ranks of Mercedes owners for the first time  The attitude you get at the dealer is   So  you re one of the plebeians who can now afford our new  cheap Mercedes  eh  Just don t expect us to treat you with the same dignity we extend to our genteel clients who buy our elegant  100 000 cars Yes  Mercedes did offer a solution to our problem vehicle   We ll be happy to lease you a new car  they said  Of course  they insist on making a killing in the process  When we pointed out that we feel cheated after paying full price for a defective vehicle  they said they would be happy to fix it  but not replace it  We now look forward to making a few dozen more trips to the dealer  Maybe they wouldn t mind if I pitched a tent and sleeping bag in their showroom  seeing as I spend so much time there  it would just be so much more practical than commuting back and forth every day All in all  Mercedes Benz has some major work to do if it intends to compete effectively in the mid priced segment it is now pursuing with vehicles like the M series  The company s strategy of making its vehicles more affordable  and thereby reaching a broader market the new CLK midsize coupe  and even the new flagship S series sedans cost thousands less than their immediate predecessors will not work if M B waters down the quality of its vehicles and the attentiveness of its service  People who pay a premium for the three pointed star don t want to be treated like second class citizens because they can finally afford to buy a moderately priced Mercedes Benz  Most of all  buyers who are attracted to the mythical Mercedes brand should keep in mind that with today s Mercedes Benz  there is no guarantee of avoiding a clunker br br  
Camera, I received the CASIO QV 120 DIGITAL CAMERA  as a gift in October 1999  I was quite excited since I had been wanting a digital camera for quite some time  I tend to think I am pretty high tech and can figure many electronic devices out without much trouble  This camera was pretty easy to maneuver The software was a cinch to install  I was warned before I used the camera that it would cost a fortune to keep it in picture taking capability  I honestly took it with a grain of salt  I was totally shocked when after taking just 24 pictures in about 10 minutes that the batter light started flashing  I thought to myself this has got to be a mistake  Unfortunately it wasn t a mistake at all  I didn t even get to upload the pictures to my computer so I could edit and save them before the batteries conked out on me  At this point I had the regular Duracell AA batteries installed  then I decided to switch to the new Duracell High Tech Batteries  The new batteries are designed to be for high tech draining devices  such as digital cameras  cell phones  and portable music players  I am sorry to inform you  but the same problem occurred with these batteries  You can only take approximately 24 pictures before your batteries will die on you  If you upload pictures before you take 24 pictures then the batteries will conk out before the 24 pictures  It just varies how many pictures you take then upload The quality of the pictures could be a lot better in my opinion  I have to edit the color on all the pictures that I take  The camera DOES NOT HAVE a BUILT IN FLASH  To me this should be a must on any camera manufactured  The camera also doesn t have a zoom function  It does have a 10 second timer that I absolutely love  It also has a function where you can protect a picture if you chooses to delete certain pictures after you have uploaded them  etc This camera is quite simple to use  but lacks major necessary features in my opinion  If you are traveling and want to take this camera along for some pictures  you can t forget to take your software  your laptop  and plenty of batteries  You can preview your pictures in the display area  but bewarned it looks totally different on your computer than it does on its screen  At first I did have some problems getting the pictures to save correctly  It does take quite some time to get the perfect picture that you thought you had taken to actually look halfway decent If you had better options than this camera  I would suggest any from the SONY MAVICA line  I would definitely shop around before you make a purchase like this one  Make sure the camera you want has all the features you are looking for  Also anticipate any features you might need in the future Good luck with your digital camera picture taking     
Auto, I have a 1994 Ranger XLT SuperCab that I bought almost 6 years ago It s still wonderful  It has a standard transmission and rear fold out jump seats  This truck has been great  I ve taken it on trips between CA and TX at least 10 times  I also drove to IL from CA in the middle of April through snow  rain  sleet  hail  and sun  It s never broke down  never left me on the side of the road  It currently has 144 698 miles and keeps on purring  The body and features have held up amazingly well  no major defects  The only quirks it has attained have to do with the stick for shifting during the past 2 summers the glue gets hot and the nob comes off but with all the miles and no problems small price to pay  The only thing I hate is that it has a different size tire then other vehicles special to rangers  Makes tire buying expensive but since that and the brakes are the only major things I ve had to replace it s dealable br br  
Camera, I bought the Canon PowerShot S100 digital camera last November  2000  This is the small  2 1 megapixels version of the series  I love it  I selected this model because it is small in size  The picture quality is outstanding  Zoom Browser EX is one of the bundled software programs which is exceptionally great for compressing the pictures to send via e mail  Yes  it was pricey  599  but has been worth every penny so far  This is one nice Camara  I have droped it twice a yet it still is working great The price on this camara continues to drop  It is sure to be one of the best values that I see on the market 
Camera, Ok  get yourself a pair of Dockers geek pocket pants and this camera is going with you anywhere you please  I personally love the lens cover on auto close  I know this way  the lens is protected while in my pocket  The new batteries are 840mah but if you search you can find 950mah for  33 bucks each as well as a AC DC charger for 32 bucks  The only disappointing thing missing was the AC adapter to power the unit and charge the internal  CMOS  type battery while you work with the unit on your desktop machine  this is an option  but I found one at Best Buy for 25bucks and it it WELL WORTH IT  With the 512mb CF card on 1024x768 you get over 1500 photos  I found the regular canon battery can handle 3 hours and about 200 pix before the low battery light comes on  I recommend 3 batteries for this little gem  This thing has so many features and shooting options  the possibilities are endless  I know the hardcore digi s out there balk at a tiny camera  but I can drop this in my pocket  with 3 batteries and never have to worry about bags  lenses  adapters  etc  As Ferris Bueler once said If you have the means  I highly recommend picking up one of these  One last thing  Canon makes a cool leather belt case for this and another belt case which holds extra CF  the camera and batteries  The camera is small as a pack of Marlboro red s in a box  to the bags aren 146t that big  I know this sounds crazy  but I d buy myself another one if I needed it and if I have to buy Birthday presents this year for family or friends  I will not hesitate to get them one of these  
Camera, It took me a long time to decide what to buy  I choose this because I had the regular ELPH camera  with the APS film  This camera is very similar to the old one I had  in function  I went on a skiing trip and took lots of pictures  The bad thing is I had to get a 64 MB card to go with it right after I bought the camera  the 8MB card that came with it wasn t enough  It was worth it though  The pictures were very clear  It doesn t take pictures very well at night though  The pictures were fuzzy  The camera is very sturdy and durable but there is no protective case that comes with it  
Auto, I bought this car because it was cheap  It s a 98 LS model  With everything loaded  air  auto  ABS  CD  and a 2 4L engine  I paid only  12K out of pocket  the rest with the GM credit and rebates  The same equipped Civic or Corolla may cost  4K or  5K more  The car is adequate to handle my daily commute needs  To get in and out of the traffic quickly can be achieved by quick acceleration and peppy handling  However  it started leaking engine oil and transmission fluid around 10K miles  It was a mess under the hood and the smell of burnt oil fluid made me think the car was going to catch fire  The leakage was fixed under the warranty  but it left me the uncomfortable feeling of owning an unreliable car  Basically  I like the car but would like it better if the car is more reliable br br  
Camera, I purchased my camera at Office Max  I have been amazed at the potential of this camera  It came with an 8 meg disk and I can store up to 80 pictures at a time Photo quality is excellent and the camera is very easy to use  I especially like the fact that there is a large LCD display on the rear of the camera where you can line up the picture and see what you get as soon as you click  That way  sometimes the lighting might be bad or the subject might have blinked or for whatever reason  you immediately see what you got in the picture  That way  if it is a bad picture  you can re shoot  erase it  or just let it go if it s a good shot There is a 2x digital zoom feature that is okay  but a 6x zoom would be better My only real dislike of this camera is the fact that battery life is minimal  If you use the LCD display very much  you can forget those expensive batteries  I would recommend a set or 4 of rechargeable batteries for this camera  but it does come with an AC adapter for shooting in or around an area where there is an outlet I would also recommend a 12 volt adapter for the car or boat Included software is fantastic  Easy to use  and a lot of fun when I morphed pics of my family and then e mailed them to some friends in Indiana br br  
Camera, Why did I trade in my Coolpix 950 for the 995  After owning and using the 950 for almost a year there were just a few shortcomings that irritated me to the point that I didn t enjoy using the camera anymore  So I realized that there were only a few options open to me  Either dump it in my drawer and forget about it  only to be taken out when absolutely necessary  or trade it in for one of the newer generation of digital cameras while it was still worth something What exactly were those irritating traits I hear you ask  The number one failure for me was its dismal battery life  Take a couple of pictures  scroll through your shots to decide which ones are keepers and which ones to delete  and before you know it  the screen is dead   due to a dead battery  The other main downfall for me was the way the Nikon engineers had set up the options menu concerning the self timer and close up features  viz  that you could have the one or the other  but not both  This was a big no no for me as I especially needed the timer feature while taking highly magnified close up shots of watch movements  Seeing as it s almost impossible to depress the shutter without even a tiny amount of camera movement  the timer feature would have come in handy had it been an option  Well  it  was  an option  just not one to be used simultaneously with the close up feature Fortunately a friend at work was keen on buying my 950  so now the prospect of getting the 995 was made much more affordable  The main reason that I didn t change brands  but decided to stick with the Nikon  was that I absolutely loved the incredibly sharp and bright pictures of the former  regardless of whether they were taken in the regular mode or using macro So how does the 995 stack up against its older generation sibling  Here is a brief rundown keeping in mind what my main uses of the camera are  which is for close ups of watches and watch parts and general family pictures b The Good b Picture quality is still excellent  with the added benefit of having 4X zoom versus 3X for the newer generation model   8mm to 32mm vs 7mm to 21mm  In the areas of sharpness  contrast  definition and saturation of colors  it seems to be at least as good as the 950  which had an excellent reputation for being outstanding in those areas  To be honest  I can t really tell if one is better than the other as I would need a professional quality printer to be able to give you an absolute answer  My printer  a new Canon S300   2400 X 1200 dpi   is only good enough to show me that they seem to be at least comparable  And certainly excellent enough to satisfy the most demanding users  Macro is unchanged  still an amazing 2cm is the closest focusing distance  Flash is now a pop up unit so red eye  while not entirely eliminated  is greatly reduced  The pop up style flash also has the added advantage in that it is automatically off until you deliberately pop it up  The push and rotate set up to access the different menus and options is very easy  logical and straightforward to use  And  oh yes  battery life has been greatly extended  About two hours of continuous use versus about 10 minutes for its predecessor While I wish that Nikon would put in a separate button or switch for the self timer  at least now one can use the close up feature together with it  The downside being that the self timer only operates in the close up mode which means that the auto focusing is much finer and hence slower versus the regular modes The quick review function is really handy  especially considering the delay between the time the shutter is pressed and the picture is actually taken  so one can see whether one made the shot or not  and if so whether it s a keeper or not b The Bad b No complaints from me this time about inadequate documentation  This is a company that obviously listens to their customers  The instruction booklet is complete  and for those requiring larger print  the complete manual is available on the supplied CDROM  While I was amazed at the brightness and resolution of the 950 s viewing screen  I m not too enthusiastic about the one on the 995  Not only is it a little smaller   4 7cm versus 5cm   but a lot less bright and  regardless of how I adjust the viewing options  lower resolution  especially in low light conditions  Oh well  I guess that s the price users have to pay for the greatly extended battery life  I have a sneaking suspicion that that the amazing viewing screen was the main culprit for the 950 s dismal battery life This is still not a camera for sports aficionados  due to the delay from the time the shutter is released till the time the shot is actually taken  In fact  there is still so much lag that one will probably find this camera inadequate for candid shots  especially if your children are anywhere near as active as mine  I honestly don t think that this is just a shortcoming of Nikon digital cameras in general  or this one in particular  but of all digital cameras  due to the way they work  I think that it will be a few more years before digital cameras will be able to match regular film cameras in the area of speed  When you see the sports action photographers going digital  then you ll know that they ve overcome that weakness The viewfinder is still not much to write home about  But I realize that if Nikon were to give it a true through the lens viewfinder  both the cost and size would increase dramatically This final criticism is not really a serious one  But now one has so many options that when one scrolls through the different menus some have more than one page  Read the instructions and just practice going through them to get comfortable and familiar with all of them and how to switch between them  In order to see how intuitive the camera is to use  I managed to figure them all out without reading the instruction booklet  To all of my friends and family whom I have chided in the past for not reading the instructions  I humbly apologize  As the saying goes  when all else fails  read the instructions b The Ugly b While still not an attractive camera by any means   the Canon Elph wins that award hands down   the swivel feature definitely makes the camera easier to hold firmly and minimizes its bulk while not in use  The 995 doesn t have the same metal body as the 950  so it does give the impression of being less solidly built than the latter  Although my experience has been that the polycarbonate type of plastics that the camera manufacturers use is very tough  On the plus side it does have the added advantage of reducing the cameras weight b A few important manufacturers specifications b i CCD i  28 5mm CCD capable of 3 34 million pixels i Image Size i  640X480  VGA  pixels to 2048X1536 pixels  full i Lens i  f8 4X zoom  8mm to 32mm  approximately 38mm to 150mm 35mm equivalent i Focus i  5 area multi AF and Spot  manual focus in 50 steps   both from 2cm to infinity i Exposure   Metering i  Manual plus numerous auto and programmed options  256 segment Matrix  Center Weighted and Spot i Viewfinder i  Not through the lens  but with real zoom and diopter adjustment i Monitor i  4 7cm covering 97  of frame i Storage i  Compact Flash Types1 and 2 in JPEG and RGB TIFF i Dimensions i  138mm X 82mm X 40mm i Weight i  390g sans battery i Battery i  Rechargeable Li ion   supplied with both one battery and the charger  which doubles as an AC adaptor  Final Thoughts b Although the 995 comes with a USB cable to hook it up directly to one s comp  I still prefer to use a card reader as it frees up the camera for other uses  Coupled with the fact that I don t need to deplete the camera s battery or hook up the AC adaptor  As I mentioned in my 950 review  even although the prices of mega storage cards have fallen dramatically  I m still not a fan of them for the reasons given  I use either a 16MB or 32MB Compact Flash card  Maybe I would be more keen on them if I printed larger photos  As I don t print anything larger than 8  X 10  I don t need the higher resolution  hence no need for massive storage cards  All in all I m very happy with my purchase and even although I miss the incredible clarity of the 950 s viewing screen  I m pleased that I made the upgrade  Email me for any further questions or comments  Gary  
Auto, Bought this car used in March 2003  and it has totally lived up to my expectations  I have never owned a V6 before  but after being run off the road in my Honda trying to merge onto the freeway and getting stuck behind one too many slow moving vehicles without being able to get around them I had had enough  I checked out the Camry and Avalon   they felt like economy cars even though I test drove the top of the line models  Got into the Maxima and turned the ignition  it roared to life  The fit and finish says luxury  My husband and I are both tall   this is the roomiest car in its class  lots of trunk space too  The car accelerates masterfully  I drive with more confidence knowing I can call on it when needed  mostly I go along pretty mellow at the speed limit  It handles nicely although my Subaru Forester with all wheel drive grips the road better  but I don t plan to take the Maxima to the mountains so it s not a big deal  Since others have done a good job describing the car  I will add some comments about some thoughtful touches that I really like  the controls are really well placed and labeled  With my failing baby boomer eyes I can see where everything is  the Avalon had a ton of tiny confusing buttons  The temperature control is great   turn the knob up and down for the temperature and the car automatically regulates it wherever you set it and does a great job  one less thing to fiddle with  Set the lights on automatic and the sensor turns them on at night  in tunnels and garages  another thing you don t have to think about  As you go back and forth from radio to tape to CD it starts up where you left off  Heated seats are a treat   great in winter and I used them recently when I was having some back pain  who needs a heating pad  just go for a drive  My car came with the Homelink system so I was able to set a button on the visor to open my garage door  I love the one touch open and close option on the driver side window and sunroof  The remote has a button to open the trunk and a panic button  There is a compartment for your eyeglasses  The cupholders are great   I can reach the ones in back too if needed  Radio reception is excellent and no antenna  plus the stereo sounds great  my husband was jealous so he went and got a whole new system for the Subaru  All in all  a very thoughtfully designed car   the Japanese really do their research  The only negative is that it is more expensive to insure  but not outrageous  and with gas prices being where they ve been  a bit painful to fill up  Since I drive 60 miles a day it adds up   but it s worth it  
Auto, Although I have not yet purchased the LX470  I have completed my research and it s down to a few last details  price  color verification etc Basically  I really liked the 2000 LX470  but I hated the exterior colors  Today I got a call from the dealership informing me that they just received the information on the 2001 and that it is going to be available in Blue  the color I want  I haven t seen the actual Blue yet  and I admit that there are a number of good blues and a number of not so good blues  I m hoping that it s the same Blue as was available on the 1999 SC200  A little bit brighter than Cobalt but a very clean pure blue in a metallic paint  This is the most beautiful exterior color I ve seen on a car Everything else about the LX470 is top notch  The ride is perfection the handling is excellent  and the acceleration is phenomenal for a vehicle of it s size  The LX470 provides excellent positive feedback and road awareness  although somehow  it does insulate you from the acceleration sensations  both in cornering  and in forward accelerations I m told that the 2001 is going to be substantially the same as the 2000 but the sound system has been upgraded to Mark Levinson  a navigation system is now available  and the colors are changing Lexus reputation for quality and reliability can t be beat  and this is no exception  The car is perfectly put together and I couldn t find a single flaw in any of the models I examined at the various dealerships I ve travelled to  Everyone I ve talked to who has one is very happy with it and I have yet to meet a Lexus owner who has had any significant problems with their Lexus  yes  I know several Lexus owners It s pricey  but if I can negotiate out the door just under MSRP  I think it s good value for the money br br  
Camera, I bought the SOny DSC p9 while staying in Korea during the World Cup  and I must admit its really fancy  After the initial charging of the included battery  I had tons of fun trying out the P9 s many features  Especially the movie aspect Let me start off by telling you the picture quality  you have many to choose from  but because the included 16MB memory stick was small  I didnt use the maximum setting because when I did  I was only able to fit in about 12 pics  But setting the camera 1280x960 I was able to fit in 33 pictures  which is ok  And the quality is very decent as well  The menu settings allow you to have a lot of control over what you want  although you can t manually set the aperture setting  but that s ok  because this camera was meant for people like me  who don t know or even want to know how to manually set these things The night shot works ok  I did have some trouble at first  but overall  the camera did work well in very dark situations  you just have to remember to hold the camera very still  since the lens is open for a longer period of time  which means that any type of movement will distort the image The flash is very bright  but it does take the camera a bit longer than I would like for it to recharge inbetween taking pictures  Roughly 4 6 seconds  Sometimes up to 10  depending on how much battery power you have left  Also  the flash eats the battery power very quickly  The zoom on the camera which is digital 6x  works very well  better than i have seen on most digital cameras within this range  Now onto the fun stuff  The moving pictures portion for the camera is really good  you can take full motion movies at 320x240  And unlike many other cameras  you can make as long as the movie you want with sound up to the storage space on the memory stick  With the included memory stick  you can get 11 minutes worth  although the quality isn t that great but it is fun to use at times  Another nice feature is the multishot in lieu of the movie  this is where the camera will take a series of pictures with one click  It s really fun to play with Now the casing of the camera is really great  It feels solid in my hand and unlike other cameras that have the plasticy feel  this one is more rugged because of its aluminum alloy body  It s light yet sturdy  and it can take a beating  I dropped my camera a few times during some heated moments at the World Cup  but it kept on going  ALthough I don t suggest you do this  Of course a great feature of all digital cameras is the LCD display  The p 9 sports a great 1 5  lcd that is bright and crisp even in the outdoors where most other cameras seem to washout  The navigation is done by a rocker button  which can be a hassle for anyone with big fingers  but it ultimately is a great piece of design  The only down fall I have with the lcd is that it isn t a touchscreen  When reviewing pictures  you are able to zoom into the picture and edit on board such as cropping  rotating and zooming in and out of the picture all within the camera  The clarity even at 1280x960 is unbeleivable  I took a picture of some history tablets while visiting the museums  and using the zoom i was able to read every single word in the picture  without having to take pictures of each section  that was really great The camera is unbeleivable especially when using a 128MB memory stick  I am able to fit over 300 pictures at the 1280x960 mode  and 112 at the highest setting which is 2392x1400  I generally use the landscape mode This is one great camera  I ve taken a look at other 4 megapixel cameras and but this was the only one that had a great design  and sturdy feel  I tried the minolta which looks similar to the p 9  but it felt weak  and it felt as if I would have to be very careful when taking pictures  which isn t always the case Sony has done great things with the DSC P series of camera s and they know when they have a killer design along with fantastic features  And this one is no different  The 4 megapixel quality should last for a few years  and I know it will last  since I put it through the battles of the World Cup  
Auto, Recently Consumers Union released an OPINION on the Mitsubishi Montero Limited  Of course like any consumer I was initially concerned with their findings  especially because I drive a 2001 Montero Limited  but it s not just me  I usually have my four children in tow  Their ages range from 10 months to 7 years Upon viewing the video of how the Montero went up on two wheels  it became abundantly clear that we as consumers need to depend more on opinions we read on the internet  from real live people with real live experiences  I mean  really  who drives their SUV like that anyway  If you drive any SUV like that something bad is bound to happen  Well mine is a real life experience  I absolutely love my Montero  Everyday I place my four children in it and every week I drive anywhere from 250 300 miles commuting from work and the sitters  I am a very aggressive driver and I have never felt uneasy or unsure of what my car could handle  In the heavy rain I feel perfectly safe and sound  In the summer heat it is one of the most comfortable places to be  In fact last summer when I was still pregnant with my baby  I found the car was the only place I could sit comfortably  We sometimes took long drives just so I could get a nap in  As for the sun roof  it is so big  even the people in the back can enjoy the view  especially on night drives  Altogether the Mitsubishi Montero Limited is a great buy  it s luxurious  sporty practical  and most of all SAFE  I recommend you head out to your local Mitsubishi dealer and ask to test drive the Montero Limited  but don t be surprised if you drive it all the way home  
Camera, I recently purchased a Canon D60 camera with 2 USM lenses The 28 80 EF USM and the 70 300EF USM The only edition that I will probably add is the 17 35 Tamron due to the price  over the Canon lense The camera has a learning curve so if you think you can just run and use it to it full extent don t kid yourself Download the user manual and read it first  I ordered mine in May and it arrived in Sept I also as of yesterday purchased a Canon EOS ELAN 7E as my film camera  Uses all the same stuff except the battery I shot quite a few pictures in the last couple of weks and they are great  But you must add a better flash for those darker pictures The 420ex works fine  Note I was talked into a sunpack unit the 4000 which had more power and was cheaper by the salesman who I have relied on for more than 30 yrs  But the unit didn t work it was TTL and the Canon EOS D60 uses ETTL only so it didn t work on that camera but it did work on the rebel series just fine  It would track the zoom but the unit would not fire in any mode including manual So take that into account you must use their flash as of this writing  The pc outlet worked fine with my standard candlestick Sunpack but even with the hot shoe adapter the flash wouldn t work I looked at and was going to the store to buy the FUJI S2 PRo when I was told mine had just arrived  The thing I do not like about the Fuji is the 2 battery style CR123a and 4 AA batteries  Also reports were jaggies when items are 45 degrees The camera of course is big just like a real 35 mm SLR The Elan 7E is noticably lighter but the digital for most work is great Picture size in the jpeg format in the very best mode is about 1 5 meg average so be ready for using at least 128 meg cards And get the kit one with the battery charger etc All in all the camera is great and I feel it is better than the Fuji and the D100 as I use a N 80 Nikon at work and I am not really pleased with the number of times it misses the proper focus Good luck hope this review helps  
Auto, As I wrote in my earlier opinion Hondas Are Built To Last  I said that when I decided to by a new car  it would be an Accord  Well  two weeks ago I did just that  I knew that I couldn t go wrong buying another Honda  My Civic provided me with 11 great years and 216 000 miles of service and I was sad to see it go  but I knew it was time  I did get teary eyed when I had to sign the papers trading it in  My friends said they would miss that car as much as I did  I was told that when I did get a new Honda  it would have to be the same color  blue  that my Civic was  I went to the Honda dealership when I had purchased my Civic  I test drove a beige Accord that was a demo car  I liked it  but it didn t feel like me  Then I saw a silver Accord with blue interior  I got in  drove it and knew that this was the car for me  One reason I decided on an Accord was that I am getting older  Not old  mind you  but older  My friends and I are getting too old to climb in the back seat  hence a four door car  Another reason I got an Accord was that it makes taking both my Grandfather Smith and my Grandma Cowan places easier for them  It was getting especially difficult for Grandma to get in and out of my car since she broke her hip  My Civic was too low to the ground  and the Accord is just right for both of my grandparents to get in and out of with ease  I also just wanted a bigger car  With a lot of friends having children now  I knew at some point I would be asked to baby sit or to take them places and I knew a four door car was in order  I know it has only been two weeks now  but I love this car  Both the front and back seats are roomy  I also like the compartments that are the Accord  The arm rest in the front seat has two compartments  One for loose change  and if you lift it up  there is another  bigger place to keep things like CD s  pens  gum and other miscellaneous stuff that I used to keep on the front seat of my Civic  The car handles like a dream  The engine is quiet and smooth  One feature I discovered by accident is that if you leave the key in the ignition  you can t lock the driver side door  The key has to be out before you can lock the doors  That will come in handy for me  I have locked my keys in the car on more than one occasion  The Accord has both driver and passenger air bags  Also  you can t start the car unless your foot is on the brake pedal  You also can t take it out of park unless you have the key in the ignition  In my opinion  this is probably one of the safest cars on the market today  If you are thinking about getting a new car  you can t go wrong buying a Honda     
Camera, I ve had my DC 260 for almost a year now  Overall  I thinks it a great camera  I still keep finding great uses for it  I ve taken over 5000 pictures with it in that time  A few weeks ago  I  quot discovered quot  the time lapse feature  I ve created some great AVI s of sun rises and sunsets in the Smoky Mountains on vacation This cameras has a lot of bells and whistles  One simple example is when you take a picture in portrait mode  with the camera rotated 90 degrees the image is automatically rotated  There is no needed to rotate in Photoshop  I played around with a friend s Olympus C2000 and was amazed that this new camera wouldn t do the same  We had to rotated the images in an photo editing program The resolution is what set it apart  1536X1024 from other cameras at the time I purchased  Also  since it uses compact flash I can plug the CF card into an adapter and slide it right into my laptop  The CF card mounts as a drive and I can copy pictures extremely fast  Just remember  serial is like a bicycle  USB is like a motor cycle and plugging into a PCMCIA slot is like a rocket I would highly recommend that you purchase a 48 MB or great CF card  The 8 MB card  just isn t enough  It s good enough for about 18 high resolution  high quality pictures With my 48MB card  I can get about 100 high resolution  high quality pictures  These look fantastic when printed on a nice printer The 3X optical zoom is nice  But it would be nice if this were more like 5X  That s really my main complaint after owning this camera for a year Here are the negatives     The LCD display eats batteries  it s not needed since there is a view finder    Rechargable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are needed   comes standard on newer cameras    3X optical zoom is sometimes not enough br br  
Camera, Set your expectations right for this camera  It s not for professional use  but can be used by one It is compact  stylish  and has lots of features that will appeal to a wide audience  1  It s relatively cheap  I got a great deal at 800 com when Microsoft was promoting their Passport Wallet    311 and a  50 gift certificate  net  261 2  It has zoom 3  It has a macro feature for those close shots 4  The camera has multiple flash options   for the reduction of red eye  for night shots  and so on 5  It has a menu system that can help you modify the camera s settings to meet your specific needs  i e  adjust white balance 6  You can toss out crappy photos as you take them 7  Olympus provides some neat software to help you edit your shots  you shout get Corel or Adobe though for really cool effects And that s about it  What more do you want  This is not a complicated camera and why should it be  It s designed to be compact  fun  and cheap br br  
Camera, I have owned this for over 2 years now I bought it because it had all the options I wanted PLUS it looks SWEET and UNIQUE  DESIGNED BY PORSCHE I had a bigger one but returned it for this one  There are other designs on the market that are smaller but I don t want much smaller then this one  Too hard to misplace  If you can t even tell it s in your pocket  Then maybe it s not in your pocket It takes very good pictures and the Super CCD can produce very high pixels The cradle is nice to have  I just leave it in there when I am not using it  This camera is very user friendly and easy to operate The 3x zoom works very well I bought this when it was close to  800  Can  It is now below half that cost and is still a very advanced camera I have had some problems with the electronic lens not coming out when I turn the Camera on  I am sure there is dirt in there  The people at the Camera store can t fix it unless I can bring it in when it is not working  Kinda like bringing your car in when it s making a noise  then you get there and it stops I would recommend this camera Fuji makes a good product  I also love Smart Media Cards Kev 
Camera, I purchased a Ricoh RDC 2 about two years ago   It stopped working less than a year after I bought it  The camera was fine  picture quality good and easy to use  It used batteries like crazy  I sent in for repair last September  received a notice it would cost  100  to repair  then in November I was notified it needed additional repairs  cost now over  300  It is now January and I still don t have my camera that s almost 5 months  Thumbs up on picture quality and ease of operation  but service is terrible  I ve emailed Ricoh three times without a response  very poor customer relations br br  
Auto, I ve been a Chevy fan all my life and there are plenty of reasons for that  After I thought I would never like any other body style then that of my 1999 1500  I truly fell in love with the 2000 body  With a better suspension and slightly smaller engine  I find that my gas mileage is slightly better and the truck drives much smoother and handles great  Although the 2000 model doesn t have the standard 350 small block  I don t feel a loss of power at all  Chevy continues to improve the durability of their trucks  Everything seems to be put together much more solid from the sound of the hood slamming to the closing of the driver and passenger doors  Overall  I m very pleased with the performance and look of the new Silverado  Keep up the good work Chevy br br  
Camera, I bought my Olympus C2020 Zoom digital camera in late January  2000 for about  900  After adding a strap to prevent lens cap loss  I ve lost 2 so far even with the strap  a battery charger  and an extra memory card  my total cost was over  1050  Lots of features I m still learning to use them all  It s great to not worry about wasting a lot of film  I just erase  bad  pictures   shoot away  Am getting pretty good results  see http community webshots com user melhouse1 for examples  even using the camera s programmed settings  Good  sharp detail in macro mode as well  The camera s small size makes it convenient to take along  but it has some minor design flaws  some of which have been fixed in the newer C3000 line   C4000 line of this camera  These flaws include  1  easily lost lens cap  I ve only lost one so far   it cost  18 to replace  2  neck strap attachment rings in a bad position  so when worn around the neck  the camera tips  up  rather than sitting comfortably against the chest  3  some camera features require scrolling through several menus to access or are  difficult to find  in the menus  4  no USB  my printer has a built in memory card reader  so this isn t really a problem for me  Have had instances where the camera does not properly register color particularly when attempting to photograph close ups or bunches of red flowers  such as roses  carnations  begonias  etc  or in incandescent light although later versions of this camera supposedly have improved color processing  Have found that it s a bit inconvenient   awkward to have to use an adapter ring in order to use filters  I also feel this ring should have come standard with the camera  rather than as an add on  Overall  though  I m happy with the camera   when the  new  improved  versions of this camera come down in price  I m giving this one to my daughter   getting a newer model  
Camera, I bought this camera because I just had my first son adn thought this would be the easiest way to get his new pictures out to relatives in a short period of time  What I didn t take into effect is focusing  This camera sucks for focusing and when you put it on your computer you totally need to render the photo to make it photo quality that will look good on your printer  And even with rendering the pictures are usually still all blurry and tend to be too grainy Anyway here are my chief complaints 1  The view finder screen makes focusing manually IMPOSSIBLE given the terrible resolution of the screen 2  In the dark you are completely screwed unless you have some sort of large light with which to light your subject yes there is a flash but its no good unless your image is focused and YES the autofocus has no idea what to do with a dark subject  The flash tends to make the pictures way too bright also 3  The battery life is pathetic  Each disk holds 40 pictures  the only problem is the battery usually doesn t last through all of them The good things about the mavica are 1  the disc combatability although I m not quite sure why they don t go all out to the memory stick as sony keeps saying they want to do Overall I guess the newer Mavica s are better but they still rely on bad focusing technology which inevitably limits the Mavica s usefulness to the point of saying thanks but no thanks br br  
Auto, When we went to buy our new pickup  we of course went to the Ford dealer and drove the F 150  to replace our 14 year old F 150  We tried a couple of different ones  haggled over price a bit with the dealers  and were just about settled  when we decided to drive a Chevy just for the heck of it Well  to make a long story very short  we bought the 2000 Silverado on the spot  It just DROVE better than the Ford  The transmission was easier to shift  manual  seating more comfortable  and       well we like the looks of it better  I guess we just never got ready for the  round  look We now have put about 25 000 miles on this truck and have had no trouble with it at all  The steering has always made a little chirping squeeking sound when turning  but we ve been assured there is nothing wrong anywhere in the steering system  and have had no performance problems with it We use it to tow a small boat trailer and it handles that fine  although you can t use the overdrive gear while towing  It is a little underpowered when going uphill  we bought the 6 cyl  but it has plenty of acceleration for us on the flats  The 6 cyl  has the added advantage  along with the manual tranny  of giving you good fuel economy  for a truck  We get about 20 mpg on the road  The 26 gallon gas tank gives you a nice cruising range  
Camera, After researching a ton of digital cameras my husband called me and said HSN had this one on and to take a look at it  I was a little leary as I have had problems with 2 other digital cameras and them working with my emachines computer and Windows ME  I thought well I won t know till I try it I was pleasantly surprised when the installation went without a hitch from installing software to taking pictures  I was looking for a 2 megapixel camera for pics of our family that I could enlarge up to an 8 x 10 with 35 mm quality this is it  I usually take pics without the screen on as this does drain the batteries faster  I have not found a problem with the batteries draining fast with regular usage and using the viewfinder  The menu screen is very easy to use  a matter of using arrows which I hope we all understand  The top of the camera is very simple to understand it has an icon for taking a picture  one for viewing the pic and one for video not difficult at all  The camera is lightweight and perfect for my hand as well as that of my husband who has large hands  Our daughter  almost 4 yrs old  takes pics for me and they are beautiful  She knows that when the light is green to take the pic and when it is orange to wait a matter of seconds  The self timer is a nice addition as we often want a family pic taken and no one around to take it  I have recently used this in the rain on our daughter s field trip altho I wouldn t recommend getting it too wet  The rain was coming down and it was dark and miserable and the pics are beautiful the colors stand out wonderfully The memory cards are not expensive any more  Mine came with a 16 mb card I believe and I can take 100 pics on it I always take pics in the fine resolution so I can get the best photo quality out of each shot  It is nice to have removable memory as you can buy as big or small memory as you need ex 8 mg or 128 mb  I am planning on buying a 16 or 32 mb card as a backup so I can continue shooting without having to delete any pics I also like the fact that there is no double pressing the button to take the pic  Some digitals require you to press and hold or press twice  This one you press and hold if you want to or just press and it takes the shot The only thing I had trouble with at first is taking pics without any shake  My regular 35 mm camera is bulky so I was used to that weight  However  after maybe 3 shots that were shaky my pics began to get better and better with no shake whatsoever  I have used the digital zoom to look at the pictures on the screen but haven t developed any that I have left in the zoom mode as I am usually close enough to the subject or background I am taking a picture of I have uploaded pictures to walmart on their website and had the exact same pictures developed off of my memory card to see if the photo quality is the same  I thought that the walmart ones would be nice in case I am not up to going out 8 mos pg and with a 4 yr old  I must say that the uploaded pics were the same quality as the ones directly off my memory  The only difference is if you take the memory in with you the photo people can brighten  darken or balance any colors in the picture which is nice if you are enlarging them etc  Unfortunately  I have had my camera fall of my desk about 5 times and so far not a scratch no problem with the camera at all I have used the movie section a few times and loved it takes a few minutes to upload the video but it is great The only thing I can think of as a con is not really a con I tend to take TOO many pictures and then figuring out the cost of 100 pics thank goodness the prices have come down to about  26 cents a picture Fuji is known for their film quality and their digital camera quality as far as color  depth etc  they definitely out did themselves on this camera  
Auto, I bought my 1990 Galant GS in May of 1990 from Dobbs Brothers Mitsubishi in Memphis  TN  The car was virtually identical to the model that had won the 1989 Motor Trend Import Car of the Year award  The 4 door sedan I purchased was equipped with a 2 0 Liter  16 valve  DOHC engine that produced 130 hp  The transmission was a 5 speed manual  Features included driver adjustable suspension  AM FM stereo cassette  A C  and  quot sport seats quot  The car was marketed as a sports sedan  and was highly touted by the automotive press  I very nearly bought a Taurus or Camry  but I really wanted a more sporty car with a 5 speed stick When my Galant was relatively new  and before the constant problems started  this vehicle was a joy to drive  It looked good  felt good  and made me feel smart for having purchased it  The ride was fairly quiet  and the engine accelerated smoothly almost to the 7000 rpm redline The first problems didn t bother me at all  For instance  in the first year a vacuum hose problem caused the fancy suspension system to fail  but this was easily repaired  I always strictly followed the maintenance schedule specified by the owner s manual  Dobbs Mitsubishi performed all routine maintenance with the exception of oil changes  which were done quarterly at various 15 minute oil change shops I thought it was unusual when the battery went dead  in my second year of ownership  The inside dome light had been on all night  because one of the doors did not shut completely  This caused the battery to go completely dead  It turns out that Mitsubishi had installed extremely cheap batteries as standard equipment  No  they were not covered by the vehicle warranty  3 years 50 000 miles  I bought myself a big  heavy 5 year battery at Autozone that was about twice the size of the original battery My first major problem occurred at about 53 000 miles  in 1993  The car went completely dead one Saturday morning when I was about a mile from home  On Monday the Dobbs repair shop called to tell me that my timing belt had broken  and it had caused severe damage to the engine  They estimated repairs to be in the  2000 3000 range   Incidentally  the owner s manual specified that timing belts on the Galant did not require replacement until 60 000 miles  However  they offered to rebuild the valves cylinders as a warranty job  for free  if I would let them keep the car for 10 14 days  and use the repair job as a teaching tool  Naturally  I quickly and gratefully accepted that offer  I continued my strict observance of the published maintenance schedule The next major problem happened at 97 000 miles when the second timing belt broke  This second belt had lasted only 44 000 miles  The Dobbs repair shop informed me that I would need a new engine  which they would provide for  5 000  They would only consider putting in a brand new engine  By this time the car  even if repaired to perfection  was not worth  5 000  I argued that the damage should have been covered by warranty because the timing belt was still 16 000 miles shy of being due for replacement  Neither Dobbs nor Mitsubishi corporate felt bound by the guidelines published in the vehicle maintenance schedule I strongly suspected that Dobbs was trying to pressure me into trading for a new car  I refused  Seeing no point in ever again using Dobbs  or Mitsubishi s services  I had the car towed to Metric Motors  an independent repair shop  After several days of looking  they located a used 2 0 Liter DOHC Mitsubishi engine  which they installed for me for about  2200 total  The car was running  but it would never quite be the same again  The last few years of ownership were a constant battle with oil leaks  unstable engine idle settings  smoking exhaust  fear of broken timing belts  which we changed every 18 months or 30 000 miles  on board computer failure  and electrical failures that included a battery explosion  I kept the Galant for 9 years and 140 000  miles  an indication of my stubbornness  rather than quality or reliability of the vehicle  In case you had a doubt  I will never buy from another Dobbs owned dealership again  Neither will I purchase another Mitsubishi automobile again  I ll steer clear of their TV s  VCR s  and other gear  too Note  Most Galants sold in 1990 were the LS variety with a SOHC engine  PI suspect the LS models had much better reliability than the GS  Mitsubishi sold a lot of early 1990s Eclipses that had the same DOHC engine as my Galant  I have observed that very  very few were still on the road just a few years later br br  
Auto, The new 2000 Nissan Maxima  I really don t know why the designers at Nissan motors would change the body style of such a good looking automobile  I think the new design is very ugly it looks to dam futuristic  its not as bad as the oval shaped Ford Tauras  but compared to the 99 Maxima the 2000 is gross  I do however think that the added horsepower and standard features makes the new Maxima an even better automobile despite the new look  The Maxima has always been a high performance car thats fun to drive  with lots of room and a low price tag  So if you can stomach the new body style  it s still a great car br br  
Camera, If you re in the market for a digital camera  there has never been a better time to buy  The high tech electronics marketplace is absolutely glutted with digital cameras  nifty features and consumer options are way up  and prices are way down  Currently available digital camera models cover the resolution range from less than one megapixel to almost six megapixels  Prices range from less than fifty dollars to more than five thousand dollars  The dotcom meltdown and the downturn in the economy coincided perfectly with the digital camera marketing and manufacturing tool up peak  The crucial holiday period saw new digital camera models being discounted as they were introduced  something unheard of until this past Christmas  Several popular models from major manufacturers dropped hundreds of dollars overnight  The Sony Corporation has always been a leader in the digital camera marketplace and that leadership position has allowed Sony to exact a high tariff from buyers  Sony Digital cameras have always been among the most expensive models available  Sony s managers may have seen the economic writing on the wall a little earlier than their competitors  The introduction of CD R and CD RW storage media in their popular Mavica line obviously signals Sony s first steps in a move away from the company s proprietary memory stick format  Sony s executives haven t forgotten the painful marketing lessons they learned in the beta vs vhs video format wars of the eighties  Sony s new DSC S85 was the first the first consumer four megapixel digital camera to hit dealers shelves  last summer  and the real news in that introduction was the list price of  799  This was well below the expected  1000 to  1200 price tag  The new Sony model is almost identical to the popular Sony DSC S75  Utilizing the DSC S75 as a platform for the S85 allowed Sony s engineers to save a lot of research and development money  These R D savings were passed on to consumers in the form of a lower MSRP   The CAMERA  The DSC S85 features the proven Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar 3X zoom lens  an accurate auto focus system  an optical view finder  and a 1 8 inch LCD display  all in a compact package that looks and performs like an upscale 35mm point and shoot  The 4 1 megapixel CCD provides superb images  2272x1704 pixels  that actually get pretty close to the resolution of a scanned 35mm negative  3000x2000 pixels  giving digital photographers image quality options that were beyond the financial reach of most consumers until very recently  In real terms this means 11X14 enlargements of digital images that are comparable to 11X14 enlargements from 35mm film  While resolution parity between digital cameras and silver based imaging is still a couple of years in the future  somewhere between six and eight megapixels  you can shoot digital images today that roughly approach 35mm quality levels  and for considerably less than  1000  which is what a 1 3 megapixel digital camera cost just three years ago b FEATURES   Optical Viewfinder  The optical viewfinder covers about 85  of the actual image area and zooms with the lens  There s no viewfinder information display  just a set of AF crosshair marks  There is a diopter adjustment for those who wear glasses   Controls  The controls are well laid out with most commonly used features linked to buttons  rather menu driven  The mode switch quickly rotates between Setup  Review  Auto  Aperture Priority  Shutter Priority  Manual   SCN  and Movie  Buttons on the back provide controls for flash  macro mode  exposure compensation  spot metering  manual focus mode  and AE lock   3X Zoom Lens  The S85 features a sharp fast f2 0 f8 0 34 102mm  35mm equivalent  Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar Zoom  The lens is a proven performer that was already in the Sony inventory  allowing additional savings when they tooled up for the S85  The 3x optical zoom s focus range is from 19 7 inches to infinity in normal mode  1 6 to 8 inches in the macro mode  The camera powers on with the lens at the mid point  so it is relatively quick and easy to zoom to either end of the range  Add on wide angle and telephoto extenders may be attached with the optional VAD S70 lens adapter  which also allows the use of inexpensive 52mm filters   Flash  The built in flash features settings for automatic  redeye reduction  fill flash  and off  The optional HVL F1000 Sony external flash extends the range and provides bounce options   Battery  The S85 s power comes from a Sony  M  series NP FM50 InfoLITHIUM rechargeable 7 2v battery  and it tells you  on the LCD  how many minutes of runtime you have left  The NP FM50 is a Sony camcorder battery  Kudos to Sony for creative engineering  adapting a high powered battery from another product line  an absolutely brilliant move that allowed them to increase savings by using a proven component already in inventory  and an opportunity to overcome a constant complaint  short battery life  from consumers  The battery charges quickly and will run for more than three hours  with flash and almost continuous LCD use  on a single charge  Both battery and charger adaptor are included b Technical Specifications  Resolution  four megapixel  2272x1704 Viewfinder  Optical  zooms with lens  diopter adjustment Image Storage  Sony Memory Stick Recording Formats  JPEG  TIFF

Handling and Operation  I have a good friend who sells and distributes photographic equipment  He provides me with  tips  about digital cameras that are real bargains  models that are selling  and performing  very well  and occasionally about clunkers and models to avoid  This advice is a great help to me because I work very hard to make my camera reviews as good as they can be  Having a friend in the industry gives me access to information that is not usually available to the general public  Photography magazines have a vested interest  advertising from camera photo equipment manufacturers makes up the greatest part of their income  in putting a positive spin on every model and accessory that they test  My friend lets me in on what is usually known only to industry insiders  His latest tip was about what a tremendous bargain Sony s new Cybershot DSC S85 digital camera is  It turns out that he had one returned by a local photographer who has been shooting 35mm for more than thirty years  This guy bought the Sony Cybershot DSC S85 after reading a very positive photo mag review  He was really disappointed when the images weren t as good as those he was used to getting with slow speed 35mm slide film  He also complained about all the images having a  pinkish cast  Since the gentleman has always been a good customer my friend allowed him to return the camera  My friend has been carrying the S85 around for about a week and he asked me if I would like join him on a photographic outing to test the camera s white balance  which could have been the cause of the  pinkish cast  and its overall performance before he sent it back to Sony  I am always ready to drop everything and go play with a new camera  even when it is cold as hell outside  Louisville has finally gotten a little winter weather the past couple of weeks so I have been avoiding any unnecessary trips outside  However  the opportunity to check out a new four megapixel digital camera made me forget how cold it was We got together early Saturday afternoon and spent about two hours shooting  street  images along Bardstown Road in the Highlands  We then made a quick trip into Cherokee Park to shoot some winter shots along Beargrass Creek  The S85 did an admirable job with the static shots of the ice bound creek  but wasn t completely up to the job of hitting the  decisive moment  in our  street  photography efforts  Digital cameras don t usually perform very well in  action  photography settings  Sports   street  shooting  and wildlife photography remain beyond the capabilities of most digital cameras because of shutter lag and start up cycle write record times  The S85 s shutter lag is pretty short for a four megapixel camera  but the start up cycle time lag is a bit longer than average  We took along a Nikon F4S with a 35 1 4 AIS Nikkor and a 105 2 8D AF Micro Nikkor to shoot comparison images  The F4S was loaded with ISO 100 Kodak Elitechrome slide film  After we finished at Beargrass Creek  we returned to my friend s and set up a small area with a white backdrop and a light box to shoot some close ups and check the white balance capabilities of the S85  The one button white balance feature works well and we were not able to duplicate the  pinkish cast  that my friends customer had complained about  We shot a large fruit basket my friend had gotten as a Christmas gift from one of his suppliers  The woven raffia basket contained two Navel oranges  two huge bright red apples  some pecans  in the shell  and three bright mint green pears  The fruit basket made an absolutely perfect photo subject and the images were almost faultless  The S85 s metering did an exceptional job of getting the exposures right in both auto and aperture priority mode  The colors were a bit over saturated  but very accurate  Louisville received between two and three inches of fresh snow over night  and when we got together just before noon on Sunday we headed straight for Cherokee Park to shoot some winter wonderland stuff in the woods while the white stuff was till new and pristine  We went to  Dog Hill   Louisville s premier sledding venue  to shoot sledders  The new snow was soft and wet  making for some blazingly fast sled runs down the long steep hill  The S85 wasn t able to lock on and capture decent shots of the fast moving sleds  Many of the sledders were dressed in very bright colors and we were able to shoot them easily with the F4S  loaded with Kodak ISO 100 color print film  and both the 35 1 4 and the 105 2 8  Once the cold started to be a little bit painful  we returned to my friend s place and he ran the slides and color prints while I organized my notes and started putting this review together  We compared the slides  on a color corrected light table with a Schneider 6X loupe  and 4X6 color prints to the digital images from the S85  The slide images were significantly sharper  with much better contrast  and truer color  but the S85 s images compared quite favorably with the Kodak ISO 100 color prints  The S85 had an irritating tendency to over expose the snow scenes  which could have been easily controlled with a neutral density filter  but since the lighting was pretty dull it wasn t too much of a problem  In brightly lit snow or beach scenes I think the S85 would be very likely to blow out everything in the scene without a neutral density filter in place b A Few Concerns  The Proprietary Sony  memory stick  digital storage media  rather than the more versatile industry standard CompactFlash  and the single model proprietary Sony external flash are my primary complaints against the new S85  Slow start up cycle times  a bit longer than comparable models from other manufacturers  are balanced by the shot to shot times which are a little better than average  No filter threads on the lens  you have to buy a PROPRIETARY Sony adaptor  The S85 suffers from low light color inaccuracies and there is a bit of barrel distortion with the Zeiss Vario Sonnar Zoom lens  Noise control is very good in well lit outdoor scenes  but noticeable in indoor  flash  and low light shots  There isn t any way to confirm correct focus in the manual focus mode   Conclusion  As the gentleman who returned the S85 we tested learned  digital photography is not the same as 35mm film photography  however if you are technically competent and motivated  this camera can be a very impressive imaging tool  Overall  the S85 is a very good performer  capable of producing excellent pictures  The camera is relatively easy to use with good ergonomics and well placed logical controls  The S85 handles most lighting conditions very well  has an excellent Carl Zeiss zoom  an autofocus system that is quick and accurate  very good macro performance  with close focus of about an inch and a half  and a wide range of manual options  The Sony Cybershot DSC S85 is a real bargain too  the best priced 4 megapixel digital camera currently available  Sony s engineers have done an exceptional job of developing a feature rich four megapixel digital camera while holding down costs  The S85 can be found  with a little research  for between  600 and  700  which is  100 300 less than comparable 4 megapixel digital cameras from other manufacturers  For more information on  How to Choose a Digital Camera  please see my review a href elec

Camera, I don t own an FD 71  but I use one extensively at work  I ve never read the manual  don t know where it is  but I ve been able to use every feature on the camera  it s that intuitive  Overall  the camera is very easy to use  the battery seems to last for quite a long time even with the LCD screen running  and the resolution is okay  not the greatest  but okay for archival purposes Like other Sony Mavica digital cameras  the FD 71 uses a standard 1 4M floppy disk for  film  You really can t beat the ease of use and compatibility that this provides  Most of the features are menu driven and controlled by a nice little directional pad on the back of the camera  The FD 71 does not have an optical viewfinder  which can seem strange at first  Pictures are always composed using the backlit LCD screen For some reason  pictures always seem crisper on the LCD screen than they actually do once they are written to disk  The resolution of the FD 71 is not professional quality on the normal setting  where you can put about 20  pictures onto a disk  There is a high quality setting  but this limits you to a single picture per disk  The focusing and zoom range of the FD 71 is astounding  It can photograph objects in sharp focus about as close as one or two centimeters  I have also found that indoor photos almost always require a flash in order to get a good picture Overall the FD 71 is probably a good choice for a company that needs to take pictures or products or other items that will be published on the web  For web publication  the resolution of the FD 71 is more than adequate  The FD 71 would also be a good choice for a home user that wants to take lots of photos and exchange them with friends via email or disk br br  
Auto, This summer  my dad drove my new  to me anyway  1997 cherry red mustang GT into the driveway  To say the least  I was in heaven  At age 17  this is my dream car  Although I have only had it a few months and have experienced a few problems  I wouldn t want any other car First of all  I love the body style  It doesn t look plastic like the newer squarer models  It also has plenty of power with a V 8  Actually  a little too much power if you live in the mountains like I do with curves everywhere  In fact  this is what caused me to wreck my car  Yes  I was driving a little too fast on that curvy road  but not too fast for a sports car  Before I got my car  I used to drive my boyfriends camaro  and it handles curves like a dream  So naturally  I tried to same thing in my car and ended up fishtailing it into a ditch  Lesson learned  I now take curves slowly  Another problem is shifting into reverse  Sometimes  it just won t shift at all  and other times it will grind in that gear  So  when this problem arises  I have to shift it up into first  rev it  then it usually goes into reverse A month or two ago  I tried to leave the senior parking lot but after cranking the engine  it would die  unless I kept it revving  We had to drive my car home constantly revving the engine and pressing the gas  which was dangerous on the wet roads that day  until we could get it to the shop  The last problem I have with my GT is that it squeaks a lot  Sometimes it does this on left turns  other times it does it in the back  sounds like it is coming from the trunk  I usually just crank up the music cuz I have no idea where this is coming from  But the bottom line is  although the car has problems  it also has 55 000 miles on it and still looks brand new  besides the dent from my wreck  I love this car  and the feeling I get behind the wheel is definately worth having to drag it to the shop every once in a while  
Camera,  OVERVIEW  The folks at Olympus have often been innovators in both the 35mm camera and digital imaging worlds  Their half frame Pen F cameras from the early sixties offered photographers the option of 72 images on a standard  36 exp  roll of 35mm film  with all the lenses and accessories of a true  system  camera  The Olympus OM1 of 1977 was the first of the compact full feature 35mm cameras  a system that revolutionized camera design  The Olympus OM3Ti and OM4Ti 35mm cameras are still available for fans of precision built manual focus 35mm cameras  The Olympus D300L was the first  serious  prosumer digital camera  At a time when most consumer digital cameras were toys  the D300L was a capable and competent image maker  Olympus followed the D300L with the C2500L Digital SLR  aimed right at the heart of the growing digital imaging movement  A quality digital camera that eschewed  bells   whistles in favor of solid engineering and first class image making capabilities at a price that withered the competition  The new Olympus Camedia E10 Digital SLR continues this tradition of innovation and unique solutions to imaging challenges There are only a handful of serious  PRO  level digital cameras on the market  the Nikon D1  Canon s new D30  the Fuji Finepix S1 Pro  and a couple of 35mm pro models  modified to do digital duty  from Kodak  Olympus has engineered a new camera  that it claims can compete with these top of the line  PRO  Digital SLR s  The new Olympus Camedia E10 Digital SLR  costing less than two grand  offers convincing evidence that pro features are available without the  3500 to  6000 initial investment required with all the other  PRO  model digital SLR s  The Olympus E10 accomplishes these design breakthroughs by using new approaches to solve old problems  How does the E10 do this  Most importantly  the camera doesn t offer interchangeable lenses  Instead Olympus has designed a new 9 36mm  35 140mm 35mm equivalent  f2 0 2 4 zoom lens that was engineered from its inception to mate perfectly with the Olympus four megapixel  2 3 inch  CCD sensor  This  designed from scratch  zoom lens and CCD sensor  combo  provide an extremely clean  sharp as a tack  and noise free 2240x1680 image file  CCD sensors are far less forgiving of stray and indirect light than silver based film  Olympus engineers took this fact into consideration and designed the one piece rigid body camera lens unit to capitalize on the differences between traditional silver based imaging materials and digital imaging technology  Digital sensors require a direct  straight line  path  stray light and reflections seriously degrade the quality of the final image  The E10 s new  super corrected  zoom is focused directly on the CCD  and offers exceptional resolution throughout the zoom range b CUTTING EDGE DESIGN   ENGINEERING  Olympus s new digital SLR doesn t compromise on image quality  features  performance  or  PRO  capabilities  Olympus claims that the one piece body and lens design offers better alignment between lens and CCD  improving image resolution and eliminating dust and contaminants inside the camera  Dust and particulate contaminants inside the mirror box are a real concern with the Nikon D1 and the Fuji Finepix S1 Pro  both require fairly regular  dust control  and a can of compressed air is a needed extra component  In addition Olympus has incorporated a very powerful 32 mb SDRAM to rapidly process the 4 megapixel images at rates of up to 3 FPS  for up to four frames  which works in conjunction with the proprietary Olympus  True Pic  system to optimize all captured data in  real time  before saving the data to storage media Olympus designed the new 4 megapixel  3 9 effective  CCD to enhance brightness perception  this is accomplished by using two green filters for every red and blue filter  Green significantly increases the perception of brightness  and this makes colors appear richer  brighter  and fuller  Three metering options  ESP multi pattern  centerweighted  and spot  exposure compensation  3EV  and auto bracketing help to insure consistently correct exposures The controls on the E10 are logically laid out  Olympus asked professional photographers to offer advice on the optimal operational layout of the camera  and then they followed that advice  The result is a camera that photographers will love  because it was in large part designed for photographers  by photographers  Ergonomically the E10  fits the hands well  is extremely easy to operate  the controls are intuitive  and all buttons and switches are within easy reach when holding the camera  Olympus says the camera can be operated in the dark  by touch b FEATURES  Two separate AF modes work in tandem to insure focusing precision and accuracy  Manual focus and manual zoom capabilities are especially attractive  since they will feel  right  to photographers who learned image making with manual cameras  Shooting in Aperture or Shutter Priority  or full Manual mode will allow the control  that photographers who insist on being completely in charge of their image making  insist on  White balance can be individually tailored for a wide variety of shooting conditions with seven color temperature settings  Virtually any lighting situation can be mastered by using the  One Touch  white balance adjustment  Auto  TTL  white balance produced some of the truest skin tones I have ever seen The E10 offers slots for both  Smart Media  and Compact Flash  Types I   II  cards  Depending on the capacity of the card employed  a huge number of images can be stored  This provides an obvious advantage  since the photographer can shoot quite a few images before the storage media needs to be replaced  The E10 utilizes a USB  storage class  interface for fast and easy data transfer  your computer will  recognize  the camera as an external drive b IN THE FIELD OPERATION   HANDLING  The Olympus E10 functions intuitively  as soon as you pick up the camera  your fingers instantly find the controls  The optional  Power Grip  is a highly recommended accessory  this provides a vertical shutter release  plus the four additional batteries will extend operation time significantly  I had about sixty minutes to check out the camera  as far as I know it was the first E10 in Louisville  and there were a couple of other photographers who were waiting impatiently for their turn to play with it  I was very impressed with its ease of operation  After everyone had spent a little time with the camera we were shown two 8x10 custom prints from E10 TIFF files that were the best digital images I have ever seen  they were comparable to 35mm slide prints b Technical Specifications  4

to see this camera as the next logical step in their digital photography evolution  Pro features  four megapixel images  solid construction  and cutting edge design for two thousand bucks is going to sell a lot of E10 s For information on How to Choose a Digital Camera please see my review   a href elec review 2E46 17B174E2 39A418E3 prod1 http www epinions com elec review 2E46 17B174E2 39A418E3

Camera, After days of online research and lots of touchy feely I was totally won over by the Canon A20  I own a Canon camcorder and was very impressed by the quality and ease of use  This helped me make my decision for the A20  From the time I picked it up in Circuit City I knew I was holding a quality camera  The weight and solid body feels great in your hands  Almost like a professional 35mm  I wasnt crazy about those micro mini digicameras  Canon uses good quality plastics  The buttons have a nice positive feel to them  The screen is a decent size  I use the camera mainly for posting pics on the web and snaping shots of my kids  Occasionally i ll print them on my HP photo printer  the 4x6 quality is outstanding  Youll want to get a larger compact flash card  This form of media is realy cheap now  It took me no time at all to master the menu system  Just give yourself about an hour or two with the manual and you ll be ok  Give a look at the specs at the Canon web site  One thing that I was mislead about was the use of alkaline batts with this unit  Forget it  The manual says you can but you ll get only a few shots off before it shuts down  Go with the 1600mAh NiMH rechargebles  You will be very happy with the battery life using the NiMH batts  For me  this was everything I needed in a digicamera without being overweighted with a lot of extras I wasnt going to use  Avoid buying a camera sight unseen  Go out and play with them at the store  Take it home  use it  feel comfortable with it  Most major electronic retailers have good return policies  Buy with confidence  
Camera, Hubby and I were in a Best Buy in April 2003  He was looking at computer peripherals while I wandered around browsing the displays  Then I thought to look at the digital cameras  I d been intrigued by the Mavica floppydisk concept  imagine my delight when I found they had a CD R model available  I called hubby over and we did end up buying it  The CD400 has many features which may require a little bit of instruction manual study  Luckily the manual is clear and concise  I recommend experimenting with the settings to see the results  A disc is cheap I took the camera on vacation to Southern California the first week of June  I took over 600 photos all on one disc  Boy  this beats film cameras and those  memory sticks  for other digital cameras  The bulkiness may be an issue for some people  The Mavica cameras are about the size of an SLR camera  My own opinion is that the advantages of the Mavica make its bulkiness a non issue BE CAREFUL with the viewscreen  It is an LCD screen and is easily damaged  I wish Sony made a clip on cover for it but they don t  If you have the camera strap around your neck  and there are buttons on your shirt  they may scratch or abrade the LCD screen  The number of images which you can fit on a disc will vary according to what image size you choose  and what resolution you choose  Shutter lag varies according to the type of photo you are taking  Manual settings for long exposures need a second  The camera will take a few seconds to process data from long exposures  This is normal  The Mavica MVC CD 400 uses a camcorder battery  which you charge while it is in the camera  I highly recommend one or two spare batteries  the camera will use a lot of  juice  ESPECIALLY for flash photos and movie clips Movie clips  Yes indeed  The Mavica has a built in microphone and will record a short movie clip in MP3 format  You can view the images in several ways  First  you can use the review function on the camera and see them on the viewscreen  Second  you can attach the supplied A V cable to the camera and a TV  Third  you can remove the completed disc from the camera and download the images to your computer This camera can do a whole lot  Below is a partial list of features Image size  2272x1704 Very fine prints 2272 3 2  Printing in 3 2 ratio 1600x1200 Printing in A4 format 1280x960 Printing in postcard size 640x480 Attaching to e mail Image quality can be set to Fine or Standard Red Eye Reduction Macro Portrait Landscape Date and Time Stamp Manual exposures 1 1000 second to 8 seconds Manual apertures F2 to F8 Focus location in the frame can be selected White Balance Special effects   B   W  sepia  negative  posterize 3 image burst Image zoom 
Auto, This is a great car for kids who are just getting their DL  and have to pay insurance  and have parents who don t want a high car payment  This car is reliable  affordable  fun  nice  comfortable  and a great run around car  This car could easily fit 4 people inside  But if we all go back to being a teenager  and filling our cars with friends to the max you could even fit 5  We just bought a brand new one at Drew Ford in El Cajon  Ca for  7995 A brand new one  with everything except a CD player  It has been great  We get about 28 Miles gal city driving  and 38 miles gal freeway driving  Our insurance is really cheap  and our payments our really low  This has been a great investment for us  Parents of teenagers This is a great car idea for your driving or soon to be driving teen  It s low payments  low insurance  and a great excuse to get your out to work and school on their own  Give yourself a little more freedom  and give them a little more freedom  It s great     
Camera, My Vivitar 2700 is now broken   the battery door is gone  and the display is cracked   but I can honestly say I don t miss it much  I bought it at an online auction for about  100  so it didn t set me back much  but I was also very disappointed with it  It is a very simple camera  that takes low quality shots  Occasionally it did actually give me really good looking shots  but there was no system to when it produced good shots and bad shots  not one that I could figure out anyway   It is a very basic camera  and if you get it  don t expect anything to turn out like what you would expect from a non digital SLR or point and shoot  The pictures I got most of the time were grainy  lacking in colour and contrast  and generally looked just boring  It is a fairly small camera  but there are smaller and better cameras around today The 2700 eats batteries  especially if you use the LCD display a lot  Keep a lot of extra batteries around  Transferring pictures from camera to PC is fairly easy  although it is obvious that Vivitar didn t exactly kill themselves when they designed the software  So  take it for what it is   a cheap digital camera  with quality to match br br  
Auto, At least not that I ve seen  And this was the car that I signed papers on  Yes  papers were signed before I changed my mind And you can do that  you know  You are not responsible until that car is driven off the lot  Like  all the way out the driveway  even if you are halfway out of the driveway   which is about how it was with me that deal is not done  So  remember after you sign and you are walking to put key in ignition  That long walk  you can still change your mind Poor Mazda  This is one of the most handsome cars in the compact class with sharper outside styling than anyone else  It s also one of the roomiest in both front and back  It s also one of the least advertised  A year ago  I had no idea that there was any such car called a Mazda Protege  until I read Consumer Reports and how they felt that it was their best compact car  even if least popular among new car sales And this is exactly the dilemma  Why is a car that Consumer Reports calls  1 not at the top of the new cars being actually bought The reason is that Mazda refuses to do the same sort of promotion and advertising that Toyota and Honda relentlessly do  The Mazda Protege is essentially a Japanese import that is put together with the same quality  I found  that Toyota and Honda do  But  Mazda s parent company Lincoln Mercury  which are subsidiaries of Ford  actually has decided to promote other cars This shows in the brochure for the Mazda Protege  which I thought misrepresented the Protege as frivolous  unsubstantial  teenybopper  and non serious  Things that I didn t find were true about the Protege  And yet my Lincoln Mercury dealer didn t even have a Protege on the lot and was very surprised that anyone would come in inquiring about one So  in the end  I was concerned about driving something that wasn t that popular and that I didn t see much of around  I don t know how Consumer Reports is coming up with reliability statistics if not enough people have bought this car to have real life experiences with it There were little things that bothered me that probably wouldn t bother anyone else  I am absolutely obsessed with interiors and the fact that the Protege s door handles were of a silver  that silver gets hot in the sun  Instead of matching the layout and fabric of the rest of the fit and finish  bothered me  The fact that the dashboard was of a different color or shade than the radio and controls  plus the steering wheel was not of a uniform texture  Picky  picky  picky  Still  I think that when everything of the interior fit and finish matches  is the same color and texture  it spells quality and adds to the plushness  And interior comfort  coziness and quality is my thing  As opposed to outside styling The car also seemed loud upon acceleration  then again  anything seems loud to me The handling was absolutely great  this could be a Honda if you didn t know otherwise I don t know anything about the Protege s safety record other than I certainly  quot felt quot  absolutely safe  And that s how I judge safety  do I actually  quot feel quot  safe in the car  Not necessarily what do the safety statistics show  Sometimes all that one can interpret from safety statistics is that there are a lot of bad drivers out there  These statistics aren t always representative of the car s actual safety  just all the  quot unsafe quot  drivers I think it was the roominess which made me feel like it was a much larger car  that made me feel safe  Did I mention the seat height adjustment which is unusual on a compact car Mazda Protege does have a cult following  and there are many on epinions who write favorable things about Protege  I would encourage those fans to try to write to Mazda to do more advertising and promotion so that more people would know about this car and the actual sales of Protege would go up br br  
Auto, I bought this vehicle because I had a lease on an Oldsmobile and wanted to terminate it early and I wanted a luxury car  Since Saab is partly owned by GM  they were able to buy out the lease for much less  leasers take note  than I could have I also selected Saab because it is somewhat smaller than comparably priced Volvos  Audis  and BMW s  and I wanted an easy to drive vehicle that was maneuverable yet comfortable  Saab filled the bill very nicely I love the safety features on the car  The directional signals light up other lights as though pointing in the intended direction of travel  The seat support and especially the head rest provide extra protection in the event of accident  The right outside rear view mirror is split so you get a long and a short range view  The side air bags  ergonomically designed controls  structural solidity  large tires  and well padded passenger compartment all add a feeling of safety to the car I hate the ignition key placement  the window switch placement  and the lack of a switch to turn off headlights manually The car is fun to drive and handles very well  I have the 4 cylinder and it is powerful enough to press you back in your seat while accelerating  I feel very comfortable in all types of driving environments Don t buy this car if you want to go off well maintained roads the front clearance is limited  Buy this car if you want a luxurious and fun to drive sedan that can handle enough luggage for a week long trip and still give a feeling of sport sedan driving br br  
Auto, I own a 98 Neon  I like it  and at the same time I wish I hadn t bought it  Its great in certain areas  style  acoustical qualities of the interior  trunk space  gas mileage  comfort  In some areas though the Neon is seriously lacking  for instance security  Let me pass along a brief story of something that happened to me  At work  I had to drive my neon to another local branch of U Haul  put my neon on a car dolly and hook that up to a truck to drive back to my branch of U Haul  Expect like the doofus that I sometimes am  I locked my keys in the beast while it was waiting to go up the dolly  I called my branch and told them my situation so they wouldn t expect me back anytime soon when one of my co workers told me how I could get into my car without any damage  cosmetic or otherwise  in about 15 seconds  It turns out with a flathead screwdriver and a 2nd person you can pull back the glass on the windows far enough to stick your arm down and unlock the door  if your skinny  After learning that little trick I never leave anything valuable in my car anymore  and I m thinking of investing in a lo jack considering how easy it is to break into  Overall  the Neon isn t a bad car  it just has a few problems br br  
Camera, Highly recommended for those who want to record the important moments  People who think they can use a digital camera and still be a professional photographer should get the Nikon Coolpix 990  If you are a professional photographer  you should be looking at the high end Kodak cameras I ve used the Nikon Coolpix 950 and 990 for work through most of 2000  but the camera I purchased for myself was the DSC P1  For me  it offered just about everything that I used in the 990 albeit in a much smaller form factor  Working with the larger cameras  I realized that portability was very important to me The camera s pretty small  and always manages to turn heads  Image quality is very good at 3 3 megapixels  easily comparable to the 990  Build quality is very good   sturdy  compact  with very few  quot breakable quot  protrusions  Not that you d want to drop anything that costs  800  The 3x optical zoom is pretty decent too  with little barrel distortion  These are the camera s greatest strengths Typical of other Sony  quot gadget quot  hardware  the DSC P1 has a plethora of gimmicky features  including the ability to record MPEG1 movies  output straight to a TV  both audio and video  via RCA cable  and various special effect  Program AE  just like their camcorders  filters  Most of these are pretty fun to play with  however in practice they are not that useful for when it counts  Despite having an inferior video recording capability  it is very cool that such a small solid state device can do it in the first place  Its too bad there isn t any MP3 feature   the hardware seems perfect for it with a built in volume control  speaker  and audio out  via the TV out port  I disabled the digital zoom when I first powered on the camera   I don t belive in digital zoom  never have and never will  In my opinion  the fact that it is a Sony is both its best and worst aspect  Because its Sony there s a level of quality that is easy to notice and appreciate  Also because its Sony it uses proprietary InfoLithium batteries and Memory Sticks The InfoLithium battery is pretty good  actually   comparable in lifetime to many batteries out on the market  You get about 1 hour and 20 minutes of continuous use with the battery  and can recharage whenever and and as many times as you want  just by plugging the supplied power cord in Memory Stick is another matter  Yes  it does look kinda sexy  but is limited by lack of competitors since it is proprietary  64mb is the largest size you can get  and they aren t too cheap  about  150 for the 64mb  This is in comparison to other storage media  such as microdrives or CompactFlash  115 for 64mb  If it were available  I would ve gone out and gotten the 256mb  The camera comes with an 8mb card  one of the worst rip offs ever for a currently brand new digital camera  You can put about 6 pictures on 8 mb  If you have a Vaio computer you can just plug in the memory stick   nice  USB connection works very similar   the software just treats the camera as a removable drive   also very nice The camera is strictly high end amateur  There is no manual focus  and you cannot attach lenses to it  That s perfect for me  I want to record the important moments in my life  so this little wonder that fits in my jacket pocket is great  If you re attaching zoom lenses and stuff to a camera  you re going to need a tripod  and lots of light anyways  so the portability aspect of a camera loses its importance  I ve found in practice that I never used those extra aspects anyways with the Nikon cameras     
Auto, I have had my Cherokee Sport since new in 1995  No problems with it at all  and have only had to replace the exhaust system  Still haven t had my first tune up and it runs very well  I find the command track transmission to be excellent as you can change back and forth from 2 to 4 wheel drive while driving  Gas mileage while in 4wd is horrible  you can almost watch the gas needle move  Although it is quite comfortable to drive  unlike some other Sport Utility Vehicles the Jeep is still very much like a truck  Pickup  than anything close to driving a luxury car  The 4 door model is nice  although the back doors are small  and it is difficult for an adult to climb in comfortably  The 4 0litre engine offers good pickup when you need to accelerate  The standard stereo system is more than adequate and sounds fine  The A C system has been much more dependable than other vehicles I ve purchased and I ve only had to recharge it once in 8 years  
Camera, Anyone considering a digital camera should read the excellent reviews in epinions first  This  review  is just a footnote to those  I bought this for my daughter after buying last year s model last year for my other daughter  the A40  Both have been good  dependable cameras  Both of my teen age daughters use their camera to make photos on line and the occasional print  what many teens seem to do  We like this camera because it is big enough to hold comfortably  It feels like a camera  We got our fingers in the picture with our small camera  For us  a larger size is important  When buying a camera don t forget to budget about  100 for essential accessories  an extra compact flash card  NiMH batteries  a case  and a card reader for your computer  Think carefully about how much you will use the camera  For light use  alkaline batteries are a good choice  NiMH batteries cost at least  50 while alkalines cost about  5 00 per set and seem to last long enough  Budget for the NiMH but hold off until you find you need them  The camera works well reading directly into Canon s new printers  There are limitations to this  you can t edit much  but you can get a print quickly at home  It has been handy a few times but if you have friends over  for example  it s a great idea  The Canon printers are excellent  The quality of 4x6 prints is superb for an amateur camera  No camera in this range has a hot shoe for a heavy duty flash  something I wish this type of camera had  You need a small case when carrying the camera around  
Auto, Have had my  98 2WD Navigator almost 2 years  amp  have loved every minute of it  Two recalls were handled by dealer in minimum amount of time       no more inconvenience than waiting for an oil change  It is a gas guzzler but not significantly worse than other SUV s  The seats are very comfortable and it is very quiet  The car handles very well in all kinds of weather  The biggest negative about the car is that in my area I am somewhat limited as to where I can get it washed as many of the car washes have only 6  clearances br br  
Auto, I bought this as my first vehicle while in college when it had only 40K miles in 96  I quickly dumped a lot of miles on commuting to college  then to work and also visiting my now wife who lived quite far away I put in a new stereo right off the bat  window tint  an alarm  the most stolen vehicle in America at the time  and new rims and tires as well  The car was a joy to drive  relatively quiet inside  great audio  and a very nice and comfortable interior  The only downside on the ride is being 6 0  you are very low to the floor  but with the seat all the way back  it s not uncomfortable  The dash is extremely well laid out and functional  the only exception is the location   size of the cup holders   right under in front of the cd player   not good if they spill and not easy to get in out if they re large  The ceiling has held up great  no falling down as you see in older cars with cloth Some have said the 4 banger is underpowerred  but considering i averaged 30MPG  i think it is rather excellent  I had more than enough power to pass merge whenever needed  it blew my F150 s 4 6 V 8 off the line The 4th generation honda in my mind  and the minds of many others  was the nicest classiest body style ever on the Accord  I love everything from the hood to the tail lights  After 12 years  there was still 0 rust on the underbody anywhere Anyway I after debating for the last couple of years  i just sold to an aquaintance  As hard as it was to part with  the age and number of things starting to go wrong were making it not worth the while to keep as a car used only a couple of times a month  i work at home Issues 1  engines mounts   been bad for years  esp in reverse 2  oil pan gasket was starting to leak   torquing bolts didn t help 3  taillight gaskets were also leaking so the florida rain was turning my trunk into a lake on occasion 4  the chrome trim that was painted black had the paint wearing off badly  ncludes doors washers 5  the rubber seals around the top of the trunk   hood were deteriorating 6  the paint on the top of vehicle  hood roof trunk  was horrible  what looked like cracks in a random inter woven design created shapes about the size of a penny all over the car  Possible that over washing contributed to this  hard to keep white clean  and definately being parked 24x7 in the florida sun didn t help delay it either 7  transmission shifts of late are pretty rough 8  lots of minor things  gaskets on things like the washer fluid resevoir  radiator hoses that failed  bad motor on the main cooling fan Regardless  at 12 years  the thing has stood the test of time and my driving which can be aggressive  esp in my youth  My wife loved it when it became her primary vehicle for a time  
Camera, Okay you have read all the reviews here about this digital camera  but you haven t heard my opinion yet of it First thing  what s in the box  software that needs to be upgraded to version 2 51  which you can get that from Olympus web site so that s an easy download for those of us who using Windows XP Home or Pro version The 8 Meg Smart Media card is okay  but I quickly got the 128 Meg card for it  Highly recommended you get that if you plan on taking a lot of pictures and using the QuickTime movie feature As for the batteries you need to buy Rechargeable ones like Rayovac NiMH 1600 mAh AA  well you can use any other brand  but that s what I use and so far after 37 photo s with flash and HQ setting they still showing full charge You might want to buy a mini tripod so you can have the camera take shots of you and someone else using the timer built in  Well it s a suggestion There isn t a case for this camera  so you can buy one for it  yes it has its own built in lens cover which slides forward and back and turns on the camera and off  But my advice gets a case for it  Protect your purchase In all you can sum this camera up  powerful  excellent pictures and cost is very low for taking very professional looking pictures and viewing them on your home TV or PC The newer version the D 520  doesn t have all the features like this camera like the ISO only goes up to 80 160 while the D 510Z has a range from 100   400 If you can find this camera  but it  you won t be sorry if you do Good Luck  
Camera, Our first digital camera was a little polaroid that got about 1 4 megapixel for resolution  320 X 280 around there  without a flash  Then we stepped up to a Vivicam 3500  It was only 1 2 megapixels  It had a flash and took pretty decent pictures  but had a terrible lag between each  Now we ve moved up to the Vivicam 3715  having paid LESS for it than we did the 3500  and we re overall pretty happy with that one  too Reason I bought it was our Vivicam 3500 will no longer power on  It works WHEN it s on  but getting it to turn on is the miracle  Something happened to the power button I believe as if you ever do get it to turn on  it will not turn off again  I m not sure how much that will cost and being as it really wasn t MY camera I wanted one of my own as it was  So with a little research I decided to buy the budget friendly Vivicam 3715 The Vivicam 3715 offers a flash as well as 4x digital zoom  which I don t use you want optical zoom  and 3 3 megapixel resolution  The lag between photos is not nearly as bad  and when the flash is on the picture snaps almost instantly  It is versitile enough to take pictures in bright daylight or in the low light of night  with a tripod  For  132 88 I certainly couldn t ask a digital camera to do more  Comparitively  the fuji camera with similar resolution was about twice as much Photo quality is very good  I was happy enough with the Vivicam 3500 to not use a film camera unless I needed a faster shutterspeed  That camera was poor for moving pictures  This camera can take moving pictures BETTER but shutter speed is still a lot slower than the potential speeds of a professional digital camera or a film camera  I typically don t feel I need a film camera when I have this little guy around as I m generally happy enough with the pictures to print them up off my computer as they come from this camera  I believe that it captures detail very well  even on medium size and quality  which I feel is plenty for most purposes  but still leaves a little to be desired when looking for fine detail or the ability to zoom or do macros  It DOES do macros  but I ll get to that Size is a great improvement over the 3500  It s much smaller in dimensions  I d say half the size  and much lighter  I don t know the exact weights but I d say the old camera with batteries weighed around 1 lb whereas this one I d put at 6 8 oz  These are estimates  So it s much friendlier to your neck while it s hanging there  It offers a great display screen that has vibrant and clear colors  It could be larger  but probably not with keeping the camera the same size and weight  but for most picture taking purposes I found it to be adequate  The controls are easy once you get a hang of them  On the back to the right it has a dial that is used to select camera mode  picture viewing editing mode  movie mode  and setup mode  Switching between them is very easy  just click to the little icons  which are easy to understand what they are  To the upper right corner of the screen there is a control pad that has an OK button in the middle and directional arrows for up  down  left  and right around it  This is ALL the same button  but selection is made by pushing it on the desired side  This does get a little bit painstaking as I ve many times hit DOWN or UP while trying to push it straight in for OK  The function of these buttons are different depending on what mode you re currently in  In camera mode they serve as flash options  zoom in and out  and timer  In menu mode they are the move  change  and select buttons  In view mode they are the next  previous  delete  and single multi view buttons  All of that is easy enough to understand  however you will probably hit up or down a few times while trying to use OK  I did that in setup once  and being as the first option is LANGUAGE and the default is English I tried to hit okay  Instead I hit down and OK and ended up with everything in CHINESE  I can t read chinese so I was lost  I did fix it eventually but that was certainly good for a few laughs   Moral is be careful of that OK button There is also a menu button that allows you to select different options for picture quality  size  and ISO  white balance  etc  in picture taking mode  In view mode this gives the option for protect  delete all  slide show  and screen brightness  This can also be adjusted by pushing the little screen button below the control pad to get the LCD options  Last two buttons are the power and picture taking buttons  Pretty self explanatory  easy to find  and easy to use  Sometimes I have to push power again as you have to push it and hold it a second to get it to turn on The camera offers three picture taking modes  macro  normal  people  and scenery  I believe this adjusts the focus  however I have seen LITTLE difference between them while taking some experimental pictures  I certainly wouldn t buy the camera on it s Macro abilities Another option it has is a TIMER  Yes  way cool    a timer  It gives you 10 seconds to run in and sit down  smile pretty  and have the picture snap  It works pretty well  which I ve discovered QUITE by accident  The timer button is the little  clock  icon or the  right  on the directional control pad The flash is quite adequate for close up pictures  close up meaning less than 12 feet approx  It does tend to produce a lot of red eye but if you push the flash button  the lightning bolt or the LEFT on the control pad  you will eventually see a flash symbol with an EYE next to it beneath an A  This means automatic flash with red eye reducer  You ll notice it flashes before the actual picture and flash take place  Drives your subject nuts but seems to help a bit  The flash takes awhile to charge  unfortunately  which causes the only real delay between pictures   Without it in good light it s very short Night pictures can be taken on NO flash mode  hit the flash button till a circle and strike through symbol appear over the lightning bolt  however you need a tripod or very steady hand to take them  If you don t get the right kind of lighting or if it s a little yellowish then the whole picture looks yellow  It seems to take about 10 seconds to finish a picture  whatever the shutterspeed is I don t know  but I do know most of mine turned out blurry without a tripod  Please also note that means if anything you re picturing MOVES that will blur  too  The more light it has for the exposure the quicker the picture snaps  but it is painfully slow if you re trying to hold it still The camera comes with 8 mb internal memory but also utilizes SD memory cards  I have a 32 mb card in it right now  The confusing part is if you take pictures on the card and pictures direct on the camera they don t show up in the same place  So when loading pictures from the camera you ll have to load with and without the card if you used both   Just use the card if you have it  You can opt to save pictures on the card to the camera  but I like the cards better as they are a more stable form of memory  I believe The camera uses a USB connection which should make it easy to install  however it wasn t  Since I have many items on the USB including a 4 hole port it was causing some conflicts with my ZIP drive  My ZIP drive is supposed to be removable disk DRIVE D and when the camera was plugged in IT was removable disk DRIVE D  So nothing wanted to read the pictures and I kept freezing  What I ended up having to do is have them BOTH plugged in and assign them each permanent drive letters so now the camera is drive E  Since then I have no problems  Think of the camera when it s hooked up like an extra disk drive  You open it and view the photos like it s a floppy disk  however don t save pictures TO the camera use the SAVE IMAGE AS and put them somewhere else or just copy the lot to a different folder on a disk or the hard drive and edit them from there  If you save to the camera you ll get an INVALID FORMAT picture when you look at it again  I have some troubles with Corel Photo House giving me a sharing error  but usually I can get around it by trying one more time  I have PSP 7 but it s been malfunctioning lately so I can t use it to view pictures from the camera  It does come with MGI photo suite  but I don t like the program so never use it Battery life with Energizer e2 batteries is far improved from that of the Vivicam 3500 which just ATE the batteries  4 AAs at a time  This one only uses 2 batteries  AA  and would also eat them if I didn t spend the money for the nicer high drain device batteries  It does pretty good  but could be better considering those batteries are more than 2 00 a PIECE  I haven t tried rechargables  but that would PROBABLY be the better option in the long run  One set of batteries took more than 100 pictures without problem except then i left it connected to the computer and it drained them deader than a doornail   So don t do that The camera has it s little quirks as you ve probably seen from the things I ve described but for the money I m perfectly happy  Had I paid more than 200 00 for this camera I d probably take it back as my expectations would have been higher  but for 132 88 I think this little camera does great  One word of advice  however  be sure to buy an ac adapter  3 3v  as it doesn t come with one and it ll save your batteries while loading pictures  
Camera, Looking for an economical compact digital camera  I decided on the Kodak 215 Millennium  The criteria were simple  It had to be small enough to fit into a jacket pocket or my wife s purse  it should have an optical zoom and at least 1 meg resolution  For the sake of compatibility with my other two  bulkier  digitals  I preferred it to use CF memory and AA batteries as the 215 does Like the rest of the package  the 2X zoom is modest  but it works  In classic  point and shoot  style  the camera is handy and user friendly  It is difficult to make too big a mistake  On the other hand  the picture quality is certainly fine enough for web snapshots  but prints are soft and slightly diffuse  the colors mildly unsaturated  It does use up batteries  four AA  surprisingly fast  A charger with a supply of NiMH batteries is a must Price permitting  the  Millennium  version is recommended  if only for the dandy Kodak CF card reader that s part of the package  Since the camera itself doesn t support USB  this can be very useful  indeed  The camera is well designed and constructed overall  but the battery holder seems fragile  Still  no trouble with anything The 215 is probably at the end of its useful marketing life  As technology improves and prices fall it really doesn t hold its own with the competition  For just a small premium  you can now get smaller units with higher resolution and better features  At half the price  it would still be a contender  As it is  we use it regularly for snapshots and as a  loaner  It is so straight forward to use and so easy to carry  I have little doubt we will get our money s worth  
Auto, The Geo Prizm  now called the Chevy Prizm  is a sister car to the Toyota Corrola  they are built in the same factory in California  on the same frame and engine transmission  but the two companies slap on their unique body styling and interiors My Geo Prizm came with an optional 1 8L 4 cylinder engine  instead of the standard 1 6L  and an optional 4 speed automatic  I don t know how big a difference the engine makes  though in this class any difference in power is a big difference  I do know that the 4 speed automatic makes a big difference  and you should search for it  The 3 speed automatic struggles and makes a lot of noise at highway speed  the 4 speed is quiet in its overdrive gear  I can t recommend the 4 speed auto highly enough I have 105k miles on the car now  having done virtually nothing but recommended maintenance on the car  The engine works great  and the transmission shifts smoothly  The problems I ve had with the car 1  Least expensive but most annoying  the dashboard knobs to adjust heat cool settings and airflow break every couple of years  I ve had to replace them at least twice  At  10 knob  they aren t very cheap  for little plastic knobs  They don t break as a result of mishandling  they just seem to break after a while probably due to degradation as a result of heat cold cycles 2  Paint on the hood is chipped like crazy  I haven t had this problem with my other cars  and to be honest  I haven t seen this kind of problem on other Geo s  Either there was some quality control error on painting my car at the factory  or perhaps the maroon color of paint had a defect  I don t know  but it shouldn t be like this 3  I broke the antenna while backing up through low hanging branches  Unfortunately  the antenna can t simply be replaced by unscrewing  amp  replacing  It feeds through the frame between the driver s window and the windshield  and has to be replaced as a single unit  including the wiring to the radio  behind the dashboard  You need to get a professional to do this for you  to get it right Overall  though  I m very pleased with the car  I regularly get mileage in the 35 mpg range  even topping 40 mpg when I need to travel distances on the highway br br  
Camera, I just received the Sony MVC FD73 as a Christmas gift from my husband  Well  we had only been  quot toying quot  with the idea of a digital camera and one thing I had noticed about the entire Sony Product line was that they were the only ones offering floppy disk storage  What easier way to take and transfer pictures  pass them along to family and friends  etc It took me only a short time to learn the basics of using this camera  And  given the nature of digital cameras  I had plenty of time and opportunity to  quot practice quot  before I went to my family s for Christmas dinner As far as price I checked with several different merchants  both online and offline  and found that you can purchase this model for about  400 with the case  battery  charger  etc There are several cool features available in this model  including a  quot multi quot  function allowing you to take a series of pictures and creating a short video  sort of like the old flip books we had as kids  The picture quality is very good  however  I would recommend using an alternate photo program to the one provided with the camera  The program that comes with the camera is complicated and the pictures do not  quot look quot  as good when you first open them  I use Corel Photohouse and it is a breeze to make corrections and add even more effects than the camera provides   The camera provides a B amp W  negative  sepia and polarize options There are also some adjustments in lighting and brightness  I haven t yet mastered these  but I play around with them for now  And I haven t memorized the  quot Program quot  functions yet  but they auto adjust the settings for a variety of lighting setting combinations and the activity you are trying to photograph Also  this camera allows for an instant review of the photos you have taken and you have the option of protecting the photo from deletion or deleting the photo and retaking it while the subjects are still there And  finally a cool idea  if you are interested My daughter just celebrated her 13th birthday and had a house full of girls over for a slumber party  Now  I labored over the choices for party favors with my daughter making faces at every suggestion  Then on a flash of inspiration I started taking photos of the girls some posed  some candid shots and I made a copy of the disk for each girl to take home with her as a party favor do you know my daughter didn t laugh and the girls were tripping over themselves trying to watch me edit their photos and choosing which ones they wanted on  quot their quot  disks br br  
Auto, There are many different S series Saturns  I am writing about the highest end model  the SC 2  The  C  denotes it as being a Coupe  and the  2  primarily denotes it as having the larger engine  The expression used to be  2 door Coupe  but Saturn has now changed that familiar term because their coupes have had three doors since the 1999 model A decade ago  I was working as a claims adjustor for an insurance company when the Saturns first came out  I was intrigued with these cars because they had a substantially lower average repair cost than any other car out there  This was not only because of their dent proof  plastic  body  but also because of the fact that car was made to be repaired faster and easier  The quarter panels can be removed without cutting them off from the roof panels  Instead of being a true uni body car  there is a frame holding the majority of the car together  just like the muscle cars from thirty five years ago  Most of the engine components can be accessed without having to remove others  All these and more make the car the friend of the mechanic or body shop However  on top of the ease of repairs  came the extremely high satisfaction ratings in magazines like  Consumer Reports  The first couple of years the car was out  Saturns were ranked as high as or just below Lexus  It really wasn t until the car was around five or six years old did the earliest models start to have problems Fast forward to 2000  Although I had almost bought a new car a few times in the past  something always happened making me keep what I had  or else getting the use of another vehicle  In the summer of 2000  I knew it was time to buy my first brand new car  I knew I wanted a Coupe  and had a price range of around  20 000  My finalists were the Toyota Celica  the Honda Accord  and the Saturn SC 2 The Toyota was faster and seemed more comfortable  However  it was several thousand dollars more expensive  had limited options  and far fewer features than the Saturn  The Honda Accord was noticeably faster  more comfortable  and had an even better satisfaction rating than the Saturn  However  it cost almost  5000 more  has a very limited option package  and I didn t want a four door model The specifics of why I liked the Saturn were because of its general features  like the third door  and the dent proof body  Also  I liked what I heard about the dealerships who are almost far too eager to please  One of the biggest selling points to me was the fact that I could pick my list of options and have exactly the car I want built just for me  At every other car company  if you want the bigger engine  you probably have to pay for the deluxe model  If you want a more gas efficient engine  you probably have to sacrifice getting anything like power windows or a leather interior  Not with Saturn  What you want is exactly what you can get  For me  the ability to do this outweighs the savings you get by buying a two year old used car For my car  I basically got everything except for the Sunroof  I didn t think that  700 option would be worth it  I did pay the same price for the leather interior  which not only makes the car more comfortable and look higher quality  but it also should really help the resale value years from now  I decided to get the combo CD and tape deck since I ve never liked the idea of having a multiple CD changer in the trunk where it is hard to get at  Since it is pretty hard to easily locate and put in a new CD while driving  I may have to change my thoughts on that if I don t come across an MP3 player someday I also paid about  1200 extra for a combination anti lock brakes and traction control safety kit  One woman I met at a Saturn event said she didn t pay for that since she doubted she would ever lock up her brakes more than once or twice a year  I figured if it saved me just once  it would be worth it  but that may be an individual judgement call I paid for power everything  since the air conditioner  power locks  mirrors   windows  cruise control  and keyless entry all came in a package  I was amazed at how many cars that are much more expensive don t have keyless entry  and those that do cost almost  1000 as an option  Now that I ve used it for a while  I can t imagine going back to fumbling with the key in the lock One of the most distinctive features about the SC 2 is the now famous third door  All this really is  is a door on just the driver s side that opens in the opposite direction of the much longer driver s door to give easy access to the backseat  It is a clever design in that the handle for the door is actually between the two doors so there is no chance of someone in the backseat opening it up without the driver s door first being opened  Also  the driver s door cannot be closed unless the third door is closed all the way so you can t recreate the  suicide  doors of the 1940 s no matter how much you want to  Whenever people see what kind of car I have they always ask about the door  Not having kids or the need for lots of storage in the back  I don t use it anywhere near as much as I have people asking me to show it to them Another point to bring up is that whenever I open up the third door  people have always commented on how much room it looks like there is in the back seat considering it is a coupe  This is true  and even I have noticed it after being a passenger in the back of other small cars  The front seats have plenty of room too  I fit a friend who is 6 10 and 300 lbs  into the front seat  once he slid it all the way back  Since his knees were straight up  he noticed that if the air bag goes off he  would be screwed  but he said he was comfortable enough for a trip of moderate length I bought my SC 2 at my local Saturn dealer in San Rafael in Marin County in Northern California  Everyone at the dealership is really nice  but I had a fairly new salesperson so I didn t have to go through the photos and dealership cheer that most buyers do  I doubt it would be that annoying  but it certainly wasn t necessary  What I do like about the Saturn dealership though is that every two months they have a Saturn party on the weekend where they give out some quality gifts  have a good barbecue  and give a little class on the basics of the car  I also like the fact that my local dealership has a mascot feral cat that they adopted  but that is just me Some car dealers may not really like to take care of you again after you ve bought the car  Saturn has always done a great job of making me feel welcome for all of my service visits  Every three thousand miles they give me an oil change  and every six and twelve thousand miles they do a host of other preventative maintenance checks and services  I paid extra for a 36 000 mile   3 year plan  I also paid about  1200 extra for a yearly detail inside and out  I m still not sure if this is worth it or not  Consumer Reports doesn t like anything like these packages  and one friend who has an older Honda says that his dealership basically put lots and lots of wax on his car for a very high fee  My Saturn apparently gets some sort of special leather coating on the inside  which is renewed once per year  and a professional level detail job once a year as well  I m about to bring it in for my second one  so I may have to update this to let you know how that turns out I also want to comment that whenever I bring my car in for anything  they also do a great job washing and vacuuming it  and use touch up paint for any little chips or scratches in the front of the car  They definitely want to satisfy me as much as possible Here are some of the other things that I really like about this car I Like the looks and the curves of the car  And what would an American car be without plenty of cup holders  There are two cup holders in the back  and two in the front  all in the middle console  The top of the center console slides forward for shorter people  The car has four wheel independent suspension  This means the car does handle well  although I find the turning ratio to be much more limited from other coupes I like the fact that it has true daytime running lights instead of just having the headlights on all the time  Cars that have their headlights on all the time tend to burn out the more expensive headlights  and may be brighter than they would like for when they are just driving around  They daytime lights are on whenever the engine has been running and the car isn t in park Under the hood  the dipsticks are all color coded and have large rings making them easy to grab  They are also proud of how easy it is to change the headlight bulbs  and other minor cosmetic fixes for the owner of the car  as opposed to a professional mechanic The car has great visibility from the driver s seat  No huge headrests  or odd shaped back panels to block your vision  The side view mirrors show me plenty of the roadway  and even average height people in the back seat don t block my view The car tries to make it hard for you to inconvenience yourself  If I leave the keys in the ignition and try to close the doors  it will instantly unlock as soon as it is locked  Also  if I turn off the car with the headlights on  the warning bell lets me know  When you buy your car  they will also give you a credit card key to keep in your wallet in case you ever get locked out of your car And here are some of the things that I don t like about the car The trunk release and open gas tank levers are too close to one another  The traction control slightly limits the acceleration  and it is always on when you first start the car  The seatbelt gets twisted up almost every time I put it on  Nothing I do seems to be able to prevent this  The antennae isn t powered  but can be screwed off for when you go through carwashes  The trunk hinges really take up a lot of room inside the trunk when you close it  limiting your available storage The electric window controls are on the middle console  This means you only need one switch for each window  but passengers always lock and unlock the doors several times before asking how to roll down the window  Along a similar line  passengers always seem to adjust the auto tune when they try to change radio stations  The stereo system sounds very good for a stock stereo system  but the front of the CD Radio Tapedeck isn t laid out very well  I find it very hard to work the radio without looking at it  All the buttons feel the same  and are hard to read at night For the most part the dashboard is large and easily read  However  a minor complaint I have is that I have to switch between the digital trip odometer and the normal odometer instead of showing me both at once like older car s rolling wheel odometers Some people think the car has a lot of power  and many people think it is gutless  I stand right in the middle  and think the car is pretty average  It isn t quite fast enough for me off of the line  and it goes more than fast enough when accelerating onto the freeway  One unusual trick I learned from the guys at the dealership however  is that having the traction control on limits the acceleration when the gas pedal is floored  I don t know or understand why  Turning it off gives me a noticeably higher rate of acceleration  so sometimes I ll turn it off before I pass someone  I think that since the car is so light  plastic body panels  that having more people in the car affects the acceleration more than it would another vehicle  so people feel like it has less power  That s just my theory The third door also has one large problem  Many people comment on the fact that they wish it was on the other side for where you would install a child safety seat  This may be true  but I would think you could put it on either side just as easy  However  I do know that since the driver s door has to open up in order to get the third door open  this makes it almost worthless when parking in a parking lot with a car next to you  I would like to use it the most when I am shopping and want to put my groceries in the backseat  This can t be done unless you have an empty parking space next to you A common complaint I read about this car is that it is noisy  I believe this is possible because of the plastic body not shielding the driver from the roadway  This may be true  but I have never really been distracted by any outside noises  nor do I expect a car to be soundproof from the outside world Saturns come with a 1900cc engine that has either 8 or 16 heads giving you either 100 or 124 horsepower  The reported mileage is 25 in the city or 36 on the Highway  add two to each if you buy a manual instead of an automatic transmission  This seems fairly accurate as I average between 24 and 28 mpg depending on how much highway driving I am doing  Mostly  I am driving in commute traffic so I don t really get to appreciate above 30 mpg conditions My car only had one defect when I purchased it  and it took me a while to notice it enough to take it in to be repaired  I had a squeak coming from the rear when I went over a speed bump  My passenger side rear strut had a squeak  I took it in  and they replaced it without any problem in about an hour Another thing I should mention is that I got the car before the side head curtain airbags were available  Not sure if they are worth the extra cost  but some people would rather pay for safety than anything else Another thing to compliment Saturn on is their web site  Check it out  because they make it very easy to see the different models  to see the available options  and it will even let you get some accurate pricing with an interactive web page Overall  I think that anyone who has one of these cars is happy with it  I m not saying there aren t better cars out there  but you will have to get up to the  25 000 price range before you can get behind the wheel of one of those  
Auto, I am a regular subscriber to five current automotive publications Motor Trend  Car and Driver  Automobile Magazine  Road   Track  and AutoWeek so naturally  my cousin asked me to go along with him to shop for cars  He was in the market for anything up to  60 000  so we had a large amount of makes to cover  Since I am an Audi aficionado  I took him  in my S4  to the local Audi Mercedes Porsche dealership first  He absolutely loved the cars  but was not in any rush to have a car just like mine  A Mercedes or Porsche didn t fit his tastes  so we pushed on to other dealerships many of them  Volvo  BMW  Volkswagen  Acura  Lexus  Saab  Jaguar  and Cadillac dealerships  just about nothing  He came very close to purchasing a great Saab 9 5 Aero  but was repulsed by his salesman s arrogant demeanor  We again moved on  this time to Honda  Infiniti  Toyota  Oldsmobile  and Pontiac  He again found nothing  As I was about to scream from frustration  we spotted a Mitsubishi dealership  and decided to give it a whirl  mostly because there was a great 1995 Mazda RX 7 that caught my eye I later bought it  and found it just right for the racetrack  After admiring a glossy black Galant LS with tasty looking leather seats  we stumbled into the business offices and demanded a test drive  It was well past 10pm by then  but a friendly saleswoman gladly pulled the keys off a hook and fired it up  The engine had a pleasant  well put together sound  The performance was astounding  considering the Galant is a front drive family sedan  It didn t measure up to my Audi in most respects  because it is in a much lower price status class of vehicles  and has front wheel drive  but considering it s positioning in the marketplace  you begin to realize what a truly great car this is  It s ride was dead quiet  the handling was great for a front driver  the interior was nicely finished  the faux wood looks excessively cheap  though  and it was a sexy looker  Best of all  though  was that this car could measure up with cars costing much more than this  Some high priced cars that this car could easily beat  Volvo S40 S60  Toyota Avalon and Infiniti G20  My cousin was immediately sold  and with his picky nature  that says something great about the Galant Mitsubishi s ads for their Galant and Eclipse had always turned me on  but I never really wanted to go into thier showrooms  Thier cars  especially the Galant  possess a very tasteful  chiseled design  but I never thought they could even come close to satisfying my Audi craving tastebuds  Boy  was I wrong  Audi rules  but Mitsubishi is definitely very cool  Before you assume that a higher price means a better car  drive the Galant  
Auto, First off  this is a sports car  Two words  sports car  This car is  not  for someone looking for a cost effective means of transportation  This car is for the enthusiast  with the exception of the 6 cylinder model  The Mustang has dominated its car class since 1965 and still retains its position as the best sports car on the market for several reasons  It s fast  reliable  and above all  a blast to drive  The gas mileage isn t great  but when you re looking to buy a sports car gas mileage shouldn t be an issue  Its not a low humming 4 cylinder so don t expect it to use gas like one  As with purchasing any car  you have to do your homework before you jump in head first  Hopefully  this review will help you along the way  The only predominant problem with the  94 Mustang is that the Fuel Pump will go out after about 5 or 6 years of regular driving  but if you plan on buying one in the near future chances are that it has already been replaced  I have read reports of other things going bad  but for the most part these are isolated scenarios  I ve talked with enough experienced drivers and mechanics to know that the Mustang is one of the most reliable sports cars on the road today  Mine hasn t failed me yet and I know well over 15 other people that can say the same about their present and past  Stangs  Mustangs are built tough and they last  Handling isn t the best  but then again a Mustang isn t a Porsche  It s a muscle car  You ll never be able to drop the clutch in a Porsche the way you can in a Mustang  Even Camaro s  as hard as they try  will never come close to touching the feeling  sound  and experience of driving a Mustang  Every time I start my car I get excited and every time I turn it off and get out  I can t help but just stare at it  It s definitely an eye catcher  The one thing that convinced me to buy this car is its get up and go power  Just knowing that I can pass someone without even thinking about it is a good feeling  This is definitely a car that will grow on you with time  Its smooth and well defined body hides a monstrous V8 beast  It s true that this is one of the Mustang s slower years  It comes after the 235hp  93 model and 2 years prior to the introduction of the modular 4 6l V8  but don t let that fool you  note  the  94 GT has 215hp and an estimated city MPG of 17  This car is by all means a force to be reckoned with  If you re an experienced driver  driving in the rain should be no problem  If you re not an experienced driver and you re worried about driving it in the rain  just take it easy and she ll handle just fine  The one and only thing I ve found to be discomforting about this car on the interstate is that at high speeds in the rain it tends to hydroplane on and off depending on road and weather conditions  One highlight  however  is that the  94 Mustang handles much better than the preceding Foxbody Style Mustang  89 93  and hydroplanes much less as a result  Consider this car a two seater and the back seat as storage space  If you want passenger space that is comfortable  look into buying a sedan instead of a coupe  I haven t had any complaints about the back seat as of yet  but it seems to be the popular opinion that Mustang back seats are uncomfortable and cramped  I mention this only for your own good  All of the controls are placed within easy access of the driver and the electronic seat function lumbar support can make you feel like a king once you ve adjusted it properly  The interior feels more like a cockpit than anything else  Another thing I would like to touch on is the fact that the Mustang has a very high safety rating  As long as you don t wrap it around a tree  you won t be in for as much damage as you might be with other cars in the same class  I only mention this to cover all the different aspects of the  94 Mustang  I would also like to note that the car s automatic transmission is not weak  I ve seen several complaints about the transmission being weak and false rumors that the reason the Cobra doesn t come with an optional 4 speed automatic is because the transmission wouldn t be able to handle it  The Cobra doesn t have an automatic transmission because it s a Cobra and most high end sports cars are bought with a 5 speed transmission  not a clunking 4 speed automatic  My mustang is peaking 64 thousand miles and I haven t had any problems since I purchased it other than the fuel pump which I mentioned earlier  It runs smooth and still has the pony spirit that is synonymous with the Mustang name  Lastly  remember there is nothing like a Mustang and you won t be able to understand it until you ve driven one  I won t even try to put it into words because I can t  If you re looking into this car as a possible purchase in the near future  go to your local dealership and test drive one  but make sure it s a GT  I also recommend finding a 5 speed as it yields much more power than an automatic transmission will ever dream of pulling from the car s 302 cubic inch engine  
Camera, My wife and I had been shopping for a digital camera for months  but were waiting for some extra cash before buying one  I wanted at least 3 MP and had planned on spending over  300  Well  when Wal Mart advertised a 6 hour  After Thanksgiving sale  and had this Kodak 3 2 MP camera for  154  I jumped at the opportunity  We have been very happy with this camera and the pictures that it takes  The only disadvantage is that there is no optical zoom and the digital zoom is fairly useless  However  I have overcome this problem by planning my shots better and then editing them with photo software  I recently took a second business trip to Copenhagen  Denmark and took this camera along  I had taken pictures on my first trip there with an APS camera  While my first set of pictures was OK  it could not compare to the quality from the digital camera  Plus  with a 64MB card  I could take dozens of pictures without the worry of film  With this camera  I have also learned how to extend the battery life so that it is not a factor when taking pictures all day  I shut off the  instant review  feature and the  live shot  feature  as these are big drains on the batteries  Then  I just download all of the pictures when I m done and delete or edit the bad ones While this is by no means a  professional  camera  it is very good for the average home photographer  If it can still be found at a low price  I would highly recommend it  That is  of course  unless someone wants to spend double the amount for a similar camera with an optical zoom I would also like to add that  as opposed to other reviewers  I have not had any problems with my lens cap   0  
Camera, I purchased one of the first 83s actually available for shipping November  99  Took it to China and Sri Lanka for a couple months with great success  When I finished a stint in American Samoa  my hard drive failed  By the time I returned home and contacted Sony  I was one week over my one year warrantee  Thank you American Express  My extended service due to credit card purchase allowed for free service  I sent camera off to Sony at my expense and shot assignments with a 35mm  When the camera came back it failed on the first disk  Back to Sony  this time at their expense  Camera came back and failed on the second disk  Back to Sony  This time they agreed to replace the drive  I was out a camera for a month  and it was returned the day after I flew to Europe on assignment  I came home a month later to find it sitting in front of my door notwithstanding directions to both Sony and Federal Express not to deliver the camera while I was out of town  Camera is currently working and I still like to use it  The problem is my experience with Sony  Into every life Durability is not an easy judgement  The camera must be kept clean as the disk drive can be compromised by a sand particle  The long life battery option is a real plus giving you an honest two hours operation under most conditions I want to try the new CD camera  While many may think the 35mm is more reliable  I lost my shutter on an Olympus coming out of Africa  This problem was not apparent  I was traveling continuously  and returned home to boxes of unexposed film  A Zeiss Icon 35mm failed on me during a camel safari in the Australian Outback  Bad news  I lost a week s pictures  Good news  I got some film developed  found my problem  and bought a new camera as soon as I hit civilization  Bottom line  I really do like my Mavica and want to try the CD model  
Auto, After I had purchased 5 used vehicles in 5 years  and putting more than  15 000 into upkeep and repairs  I decided to look at a new car  It was purely by chance I was standing in the used car lot at Incredible Auto in Billings  MT when I turned to the salesman and asked him   What kind of deal can you make me on a new KIA  And so the story begins  This was in July of 2000 and I remembered I had heard several comments on KIAs  Some fair  but mostly were good  After wheeling and dealing for about 45 min  I drove off the lot with a brand new 2000 Violet Mist KIA Sephia  with an snazzy looking wood dash kit from the factory  really spices up the interior  Then and now  out here at least  KIAs come with a 10 year 100 000 mile Power Train warranty and an additional 5 year 36 000 mile roadside assistance warranty  I drive 140 miles each day just to get to and from work and home  This is why I needed an economical and trust worthy vehicle  My first tank of gas I got 36 MPG  Since then it has averaged out to 26 30 MPG   This is winter gas  and this is with starting the car and leaving it running for 10 45 min while I m in the store  house  or it s warming up  These are necessary actions in  40 deg  weather The only drawbacks I have experienced since I bought the car was that the paint on the hood  NOT warranted  chipped very easily  After 3 weeks  approx  900 miles  there were numerous rock chips in the paint  How do you fix it  I bought a front end mask that really sharpens the look of this car up a lot and also added protection for the paint  Also  after about 10 000 miles I noticed that my gas mileage was significantly dropping  Last Friday night my  CHECK ENGINE  light turned on and later went off again  I took it to the dealership and the O2  Oxygen Sensor is faulty  Easy to fix  still safe to drive  and part will be in early next week  No sweat  The stereo isn t the highest quality and there are NO wire harnesses made for installing after market decks  however a reliable shop will T Tap into the existing harness with little or no trouble I am not the wealthiest of people  and cannot afford the time or money required to maintain another used vehicle  and haven t had to do so  I would say  I got a GREAT car for a GREAT price  without compromising anything  
Auto, I bought my 1998 Dodge Dakota 4cyl  in November of 1997  I have enjoyed my truck for the most part  although it has needed a few repairs here and there  The repair that has been the most bothersome is due to a flaw in the bolts holding the exhaust manifold to the engine  When I first experienced problems with these bolts  the service department at the local Dodge dealership had a large amount of difficulty finding the problem  Second time around  the problem was diagnosed immediately The truck is somewhat underpowered  although it is sufficient to tow my boat  It does seem to lag when the Air Conditioning is turned on I bought this truck to satisfy my need for a vehicle that is both reliable and useful  On both of these points it has done rather well I thoroughly enjoy its responsiveness and handling  but wish that the repair that was done on it would not continue to occur I would recommend that if you are considering buying a Dakota  that you overbuy on engine size  as the cost is rather insignificant  and there are plenty of larger engines in the Dakota lineup I will be buying another Dakota soon I want the 4 door  and the big engine next time though br br  
Camera, I acquired this camera as a Christmas present in 2002  At first I was extremely excited at finally getting a good camera  as my previous camera was just an Intel webcam  Naturally  it was the first new toy I played with b First Look  Upon opening the box  the first thing I noticed was the lack of AC adapter for the camera   No big deal  I thought   I have my own universal adapter  Instead of digging it out  I grab a pair of AA batteries to use  Once I m going  I take about 10 15 pictures with the flash and LCD screen going before they end up completely drained  While changing out the batteries for another pair  which annoyed me  I get bumped by my cousin in his new big wheel  which causes me to drop my precious new camera  It survived the fall except for the front blue plate  which promptly decided to pop off  That was no big deal either  a few drops of super glue and I was once again on my way b Continued Use  Since then  I ve used it a total of about 3 4 times a month to take pictures of various events or on trips  So far the quality is still high  I ve been taking care of it  so no more physical problems have arisen  I use it for a webcam mostly  since I hate having to constantly change batteries  That way I m able to just leave it connected to an AC adapter b Nitpicks  As you ve read above  the battery life rather irks me  I should be able to take many more pictures before having to change batteries  Granted  having a device that is completely electronic tends to draw more power  but if you can have a CD player with a CD spinning constantly for several hours on nothing but two AA batteries  how come this camera can t take more than 15 pictures  There s obviously some power consumption issues with the parts p Another nitpick would be the construction of the case  The plastic looks a little toyish and can probably easily crack if you dropped it on something such as cement  I know they were going for a portable sized camera here  but the construction looks a bit more shoddy than it probably should be p Something else I ve noticed recently is the amount of blur in the picture  If you don t have the camera completely still or if you re moving  such as in a car  the image can be blurred heavily  I noticed this when I tried taking surprise pictures of friends  I d stick the camera out about 4 feet in front of their face and snap the picture  but they d come out with a weird blurred effect  which still baffles me since I d have the camera fairly still before hitting the shutter button b Overall  This camera would probably be fine for a younger person who just wishes to take normal everyday pictures or use it as a webcam  For anyone else who wishes to have a quality camera to take vacationing or to use for long periods of time may wish to opt for a better camera in the price range or pay extra for better quality and battery life  While I m not complaining since I received the camera as a gift  I wish to let anyone else looking to buy this camera a heads up on its features and drawbacks  
Auto, My family bought this mini van because a  Size was right for my family of three for hauling roadtrip luggage  yet small enough for relative ease of manueverability  b  very good ratings from Consumer Reports as to its maintenance record  c  its price  However  within three months we had problems  Our Voyager had only 5000 miles when its engine serpentine belt began to shread itself  After dealer replacement under warranty  we went to 9 000 miles on it and had to have it serviced again for the same problem  Inquired with Chrysler twice as to if this was a continuous problem with the 6 cylinder 3 0 liter engine and didn t get a response  This weekend we found an oil leak after a recent oil change  Turns out that the gasket of the oil change plug was so worn by the 18 000 mile oil change that it had to be replaced  Overall  though we ve had a good experience with our Voyager  we may or may not purchase another Chrysler vehicle  That depends upon how we re treated by Chrysler dealership personnel in the future  We really like the Voyager for its roominess when we travel  but when I have to cut myself just changing the insanely placed air filter  I have my doubts br br  
Camera, The Sony Mavica MVC FD73 is my third digital camera  The controls are flawless  This is the smoothest operating digital camera I have ever used    The floppy drive is ultimately compatible  Who doesn t have a floppy drive  No cables or tiny expensive memory cards  No drivers to install  No compatibility issues  Floppies are dirt cheap and available just about anywhere  The LCD screen is great  much larger than my Olympus  and it is on all the time as a viewfinder    10X optical zoom is really nice  Don t be fooled my digital zoom which lowers resolution  Macro is great  too  You can get REALLY close to a small item and still focus  640x480 resolution is adequate for web design and general use  This is not a replacement for a film camera  You don t want to be printing 8x10 s from this camera  That said  I do take it on trips and use it more than my film camera  BATTERY LIFE  This camera gets about 1 5 hours of use with the included battery and up to 2 5 hours with an upgraded battery  It comes with a Sony Infolithium NP F330 I love this camera  The only thing I could ask for is more resolution  so I could get rid of my Olympus digital camera  Sony has higher resolution cameras  but this one was in my price range and is perfect for my web design  Great for anyone who needs product pics UPDATE After about two years  I still use this camera on a nearly daily basis  When a customer calls or emails me with a question about a product  I can simply snap a few pics and email them away in a matter of seconds  This is by NO means a replacement for a digital camera  However  this is definitely the BEST camera for web design and online product photos  You will not find a better 640x480 dpi camera  
Camera, Having shot close to 2 000 pictures in the last month and a half with this camera  take my word for it  the Coolpix 5700 is an excellent camera  It does have a few limitations  but few cameras can compare to it in the bang for bucks stakes  Lets start off with the negatives first  1  At anything above ISO 200 film speed the pictures start showing a lot of noise  this however is true with almost all digital cameras  However if you get a regular sized printout of your picture the noise is not that apparent  blowing up the picture is another matter though  Also if you re always going to keep the camera on auto mode  you need not worry about this problem  the folks at Nikon know the limitations of the camera and don t let it go into higher film speed modes in automatic mode 2  The enormous amounts of options  menus  buttons etc  can be bewildering at first  Again if you re only pointing and shooting on auto mode  this is not that worrisome a problem  And honestly i bought the camera specifically because it had so many options 3  The 32 MB card included with the camera is way too small  256 MB would have been better  IBM s 1GB Microdrive is best 4  In low light conditions the Coolpix gets confused and finds it hard to focus quickly  Migrating from a film based SLR  also a Nikon  I found this problem to be a bit annoying  Also the Coolpix is not happy taking action or sports shots which require quickness from the camera And that s about it  Everything else about the camera is fantastic  It has an amazing 8x zoom lens  35 280 mm  and with the optional telephoto lens this can be extended to 420 mm  Candid photography reaches a new level with this camera  The picture quality is awesome  and if you are really into photography  playing with all the options available in the user modes is great fun  I personally have one mode set up for Black   White pictures  another one for continuous picture taking and the third one for manually adjusting the aperture and shutter speeds  The other digital camera i own is a Minolta Dimage F100  even though that is a great little camera its biggest fault is the fact that it uses up batteries like there s no tomorrow  With the Nikon that problem is solved by the rechargable EN El1 battery  which can operate for about 2 hours continuously and can take about 150 pictures on one charge  I was put off with EVF  Electronic viewfinder  initially  as it cannot compare to an SLR s view  But i ve gotten used to it overtime and i find that it actually works quite well  And there s always the option to use the highly adjustable LCD monitor at the back And the best thing about it is ofcourse the versatility that only a digital camera can provide  You take a picture  look at it  say ah ah this is not exactly what i wanted  tweak the settings try again  and so on  until you get that perfect picture In summary  the Coolpix 5700 has all the goodies you d expect from one of the best camera manufacturers in the world  Don t buy it as a replacement for an SLR because it isn t  though it comes close  It is simply the best prosumer digital camera out there  and in my case it has made me a better photographer than i ever was before  I think that should be praise enough  
Camera, I am fairly new to the digital camera world but I did a lot of research for a client who was looking to buy  While looking for his camera I found the Canon A20 along with others but the Canon always won out in the reviews  It didn t meet my clients needs  however  it would meet mine  So I decided after about 2 months of reading reviews and talking to owners  sellers  etc  to give it a try  I m glad I did too  I am running Win XP Professional at home and this has created a little havoc with other software  NOT for the Canon A20  I loaded the drivers and after taking a few shots plugged it in and whammo it found the camera and asked me what to do  This is one of the easiest to use cameras I have ever owned  I did however spend the money and buy the Rayovac model ps4 1 hr fast battery recharger and NiMH batteries  It doesn t eat them as quickly as it does regular batteries  I also bought an additional 64 MB Sandisk memory card  which is cheaper than the Kodak memory cards  The old saying holds true  You get what you pay for  I would recommend this camera to anyone who is new to the digital world  
Auto,  The 1992 Ford Taurus  was now in its 2nd generation  many car companies for 1992 had revised their sedans to look more aerodynamic  so Ford had to do something to stay on top in the style department  Unfortunately this attempt resulted in a more blase look  The 1992 Ford Taurus  while improved in some areas  never made it past 1st base in other areas   The 1992 Ford Taurus  is not much different than the 1991 models  the 2 4 liter  90 horse powered engine is finally dropped  but there still is an anemic 140 horsepower 3 0 Vulcan V6 as its base engine  The 1992 also weighs more than its predecessor  tipping the scales for the first time over 3 100lbs  The next engine is the Essex 3 8 engine  It too has 140 horsepower  but unlike the Vulcan 3 0 it gets all its power at a much lower RPM  and has more torque  215lb ft  The top of the line engine is the 3 0 DOHC engine that was built partly by Ford  and mostly by Yamaha in Japan  This engine cranks out an impressive 220 horsepower  and will burn rubber if you don t watch your right foot at a stop light  This engine unfortunately is only available in the top of the line  SHO  models  and they only come with a 5 speed manual for this year  The AXOD transmission still  after thousands of complaints  comes in the GL and LX models with the OHV 3 0 and 3 8 engine  Ford obviously did not listen to their customers very well i Driving Impressions i   T he LX equipped with the 3 0 is what most of the critics called  anemic   boring  and just  plain sad  this lack of power problem was obviously an issue that I did not share alone  This car not only was slow in the lightweight models of the mid 1980s  but for 1992 it s even slower with the added weight and no increase in engine power  The 1992 Ford Taurus  of course is not a race car  however shouldn t  acceleration  onto the freeway at a decent pace be a standard amenity in an almost  20 000 family car  I think so  Remember  when these cars were new they were not exactly cheap  some LX models were as much as  21 000  a good engine  with adequate power is not asking too much  is it  My Test car  a 1992 LX only had 82 000 miles on it  but felt like it had much more  There were tears in the headliner and vanity mirrors  the carpet was worn  the back seat had tears in the cheap leather  This car looked as though it had been through the war  There was even a time while accelerating up hill that the transmission totally slipped out of gear  I had to shift to neutral then back to D  After letting off of the gas pedal  the transmission let itself go back into high gear  and I resumed my way up the hill at around 45 MPH on the freeway  very dangerous when the speed limit is 80  but I had no choice i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  is not too bad  I ve never personally been in a 92 Taurus when it was brand new  lets see  in 1992 I was around 14 years old  But I can imagine what this car probably looked like  The leather probably looked plush  the headliner fitted like a nice pair of leather pants  and the transmission as silky smooth as my skin  that s me trying to be funny  Anyway enough about probably s  this car is now 10 years old and it is pretty darn close to what many would consider junk  The interior does boast tons of room  trunk room included  There is 6 way power seats with lumbar support as an option for the LX  leather  a cold AC  an optional electronic dash  electric antenna  5 MPH bumpers  front air bags  finally  ABS is an option  The 6 speaker Ford sound system probably would have been good  but it didn t work so I can t comment   Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  looks much like the 1st generation s  The rear looks a little more square  there is modified tail lights and head lights  body colored bumpers and door handles  more attractive stock rims  and paint has been revised so it doesn t wash off as easy as the previous 1st generation models  When I say  wash off  in a number of cases this actually happened with first generation Ford Taurus i Price i  The  price  for a 1992 LX Taurus will cost you around 3 000 dollars  In many cases these cars are being given away  or close to it   Other Cars To Consider b i 1  Dodge Intreped 2  Eagle Vision 3  Chevrolet Lumina  a href content 63653777028 http www epinions com content 63653777028 a   My Review 4  Honda Accord 5  Toyota Camry 6  Chevrolet Corsica 7  Plymouth Acclaim 8  Dodge Dynasty 9  BMW 3 series 10  Ford Thunderbird  Happy Car Shopping  
Camera,  Awesome  I thought  My small town Wal mart does sell a digital camera Reasons that fooled me into buying  1 inexpensive 2 comes w  a 4 MB memory card that can store up to 330 pics  3 comes w  4 AA batteries 4 pictures can be uploaded to a computer 5 can take pictures up close and far away I found out  1 it s inexpensive for a reason 2 turns out you can only store 330 pics if you use the lowest quality of picture  45 w  the highest quality 3 the batteries only last for about 25 pics if the LCD screen is on 4 the pictures upload slow 5 pictures taken a foot close or very far away turn out blury This camera is useful if you   have time to wait between pics  only have  100 to spend This camera is not useful if you   plan to take pictures at a party  plan to take pictures of something moving  plan to take a lot of pics w out having to change batteries  plan to take pictures at night  plan to be hassel free Other Problems   software not compatible w  Windows NT  settings change on you without you touching a thing  bulky  Damn  my small town Wal mart ripped me off w  this PDC640 crap  I realized   I think they realized it too because they discontinued it shortly  
Auto, Out of boredom  I went to test drive an Xterra  I had done some research on the Nissan website  so I knew a lot about the truck to begin with  I did not plan on buying anything for another year  I had the salesman go with me on the test drive  and I asked questions on everything  It s roomy on the inside  and has compartments everywhere  Anyway  I was pretty impressed with the answers he gave  I saw a terrain area and decided to test the 4x4  When I got back on the highway  I put it back in 2x4 and heard the brush falling out from the bottom of the truck  I gave the salesman my checkbook right there I bought the XE  with the Sport  Utility and Power packages  Some nice extras that I like  the power to the windows stays on for a few minutes after the key is out of the ignition  Also  for short people like myself  there is a handle to pull the hatch down  Not to mention the window shade to hide your gear  the back seats come out for more room  and the back seats sit up high  so your back seat drivers can have a clear view  The truck is very roomy  I bought 5 bookcases today  and fit them all in the truck in one trip  It fits ALL of your gear  groceries  work stuff  and other junk Now the cons  In my opinion  these are minor  If you put the back windows down while you re on the expressway  you get a helicoptor sound  due to the roof rack  wind buffet  Of course  the gas mileage sucks compared to a car  but the gas tank is only about 15 gallons so you re not spending your paycheck at the gas station  This is expected for an SUV  The back windows only go down half way  my personal pet peeve with most cars  Finally  it s such a good truck that you see them everywhere you go Overall  it s a great SUV that handles like a truck  It will look good on you  and you ll turn heads when driving Go  head but it  
Auto, The Dodge Neon has a cute look but behind that cute look there are many problems  I was 18 and my parents were buying me my first car  We were immediately attracted to the cute look and the price  I thought it was the ultimate chick mobile  I soon found out that looks can be very deceiving I had bought a 1997 Neon and my nightmare started at about 9 000 miles  My car would actually accelerate on its own  At least that is what i like to say  But it really did  The engine would race and the car would actually accelerate even if i had my foot on the break  The car was taken back to the dealer too many times to count and they tried replacing everything because they didn t know what it was  To make it worse they tried to make me pay for all of it  But the car was still under warranty and my dad had to fight with Dodge to make them pay for it  They replaced just about everything but nothing fixed this car  I truly believe that it was lemon  I finally had to get rid of the car because things were getting so bad  I honestly felt that the car was unsafe to drive  The Dodge dealership that we went to was not very helpful at all they didn t go out of their way to help us  I was never provided with a rental car for any of the times it was at the dealership  On many occassions it was at the dealership for many days  I don t feel that the service department or dogde in general handled my case very well  I have never heard anyone who owns a Neon say anything good about it  The only good thing about it was that it got good gas mileage  But the bad things definitely out weighted the good things br br  
Camera, i highly recommend people to get this camera I had a hard time with all the other camera s i ve bought but this one really comes in handy First of all it s a small camera which can be put anywhere like in your pocket This is great so you don t have to carry it around all the time  Also the pictures come out very clear and if you don t like the way it looks you can delete the picture and try again  With other camera s you d have to wait till after you payed for the film to be developed to get back pictures that came out horrible  I ve had that experience with one of the camera s i used on vacation  i expected my pictures to come out great but after i got them back they came out blurry or to much to the side With the canon digital you get clear shots and you won t have to worry about getting back bad pictures Another thing that s good about this camera is that you can transfer pictures from the camera to a scanner on the computer  For example  my brother just had a baby and i have an aunt that lives in California  What we did was put the pictures from the digital onto the scanner and sent them to her through e mail  All in less then a few hours  
Camera, My husband bought me this Fuji Camera for me  I buy and sell alot on ebay and with all the photos I had to take  he thought this would be better  I was leary  Digital I said  Sounds complicated The camera is lightweight  silver in color and not a lot of buttons or dials to work with  It comes with softwear to hook it right up to your computer  which we did So we started by playing around and you know it is fun The view finder is nice and can act like a video view finder showing everything in front of it even as you move  I like this feature alot It has only two modes for pictures one is normal and then magnified 2x  It is easy and has an automatic flash and focus abilities  It has red eye reduction and a little hand to help you with shakiness when you go to take your picture you have two lights red or green  Of course green is go  and then you click the shutter button and you take the pic  wait maybe 2 seconds and in the view finder is the picture you just took  Now is the fun part don t like it trash it  Yep  you can get rid of it and do it again  I like that a lot  Not that I take bad pics but  hey  we are not all perfect After you take your pictures you go to you computer and attach the plug to your camera and go to the program and it is so easy to transfer pictures from the disc  to the puter  The worst part of this is I use batteries and this stage eats the batteries very fast  so an AC adapter is a must for this  I like the camera and very happy my husband thought of me to buy it  He bought me a lap top two years ago  he now has it at work for his business check with me in two years to see who has the camera LOL  Gotta love them  huh ladies   br br  
Auto, This is a medium performance car that I enjoy having and driving  At 136HP  I just love that overdrive button when getting on the highway  The seats can be set to be just comfortable enough to enjoy a long ride  but not too much to fall asleep on them  I admit it doesn t have a spheric  chromatic feeling like most compact cars  but it s a car that gets me from point A to point B quick and efficiently Living in quebec  cars need winter tires  I was using this car on all season tires all year long  and managed to never have a single accident  I did happen to make 2 consecutive 180s in a curve when driving to my friend s house one night  a clockwise 180  the car was propelled backwards  so I hit the neutral and managed to make a counter clockwise 180 and put Drive back on  It also happened on the high way that I almost lost control  but thanks to the manoeuvrability of this car  I was able to make it safely  the same night about 20 or so accidents related to the weather were reported in the area This car can nicely take curves and bumps  and I feel comfortable using a constant speed in areas where most people don t  including a curve formely famous for deadly accidents  The built in stereo is of medium class  well  it would be considered good for a  94 I guess  The cassette player had to go  so I put money aside and put in a cd player and a new antenna  New music I get the Buzz station better than most of my friends  The speakers work great even with my new radio All the parts are really easy to get  all parts I need fix  I can get the very same day  even on weekends  The downside of this car is it s engine  I m not much of a mechanic  but lots of my friends are  Since it s a japanese car  the parts are very packed together  Lucky thing my friend new a garagist who new himself in these  it took him a solid 90 minutes to fix my starter since everything was jammed up together  Other bad thing are the cup holders  I can t have a cup without blocking the vent control system ontop and the ashtray under  which my mother needs when smoking b Stats  Horse Power  136 Mileage  just over 173 000 kilometers Common destinations  dance clubs  friends  houses  school  scouts Quarter mile estimate time  16 seconds add ons  Sony CD Player  new Antenna b Problems I had in the past year  Oil pan had a crack  needed to replace it The rubber around the wheels under the car  to prevent dirt from entering and breaking the parts  ruptured The starter failed on me The hood latch got stuck  so had to drive a few miles at low speed  having chances of the hood deciding to let go  just needed some WD 40 and pryers to fix  the wire was loose The trunk cannot be opened by inside the car  it has to be opened by key My key is somewhat broken  the car can run  even if I take my key out while it s running b Recommendations  Since this is a 2 door car  it s obviously not a family car  I would say it s a practible car for going to work or groceries  and would be mostly of good usage for a single person or a couple Make a casual check on it and you ll be satisfied  I haven t done any checkups  and it started acting up on me Replace that cassette player by a CD or MP3 player 
Camera, I absolutely love the Panasonic Lumix digital camera  I have never in my life seen a camera produce such professional quality pictures  I have used my Lumix in just about every light condition possible  even in the rain  Its amazing clarity will leave you wanting to take more and more pictures  The Panasonic Lumix DMC LC40 is an amazing little piece of equipment  It offers a 3 0 mega pixel picture quality and even a 30 second video capture capability with sound  The best thing about digital cameras is that you no longer need to purchase film  A small memory stick will do the trick  The Lumix comes supplied with an 8 megabyte memory stick which is capable of holding up to 45 pictures  You can purchase higher megabyte cards to hold even more pictures  The Lumix has an LCD screen on the back so that you may view your picture as soon as you take it  If you don t like it  you can just delete it With the Lumix LCD screen you get an on screen menu full of options  You can delete one or all of your pictures from your memory stick  you can protect your pictures so they don t become deleted  You can even set up a slide show with or without the use of audio and change the duration of each slide from 1 to 5 seconds each  Lumix lets you add an audio dub to your pictures and even lets you resize  trip or format them right there on your camera  You can set your Lumix to take the best quality pictures by changing the environmental option  Such as indoors  or out  Taking pictures at sporting events  up close pictures of nature  taking pictures of family and friends to eliminate red eye  and even taking pictures when the exterior light is not just right  There is so much you can do with this Panasonic Lumix  The possibilities are endless  Such as with the 3 times zoom  you can get up close and personal with your subject  Although I feel that when zooming in from far away the Lumix zoom power is lacking  When purchasing the Lumix  you get the camera itself which also has the lens changing capabilities for when you want a larger zoom  You get a USB adapter cable to connect to your computer  You also get a CDROM from Panasonic that offers a picture placement and organization program and of course you get the instruction manual available in many different languages  All in all  this is an excellent camera  I am a firm believer that when it comes to digital cameras that you get what you pay for  The Lumix is worth every bit of it I purchased my Lumix from my local Military BX for U S 459 00 but I believe you can order these on line plus newer versions from panasonic com  Also for first hand views of what this camera can do   not sure if I can do this  but check out my personal website which is listed on my member profile  Promise  no selling of anything  Just pictures of castles and the family  
Camera, I received my D 600L last Christmas as a gift  and since that time I have used it for a wide variety of scenes  landscapes  seascapes  family in the home and on our farm  houses under various lighting conditions  and even some  quot artsy quot  shots of people outdoors and under natural low light and flash conditions indoors  It takes good pictures in terms of resolution  and the cable transfer from the camera to my computer of up to 12 images at a time has been flawless  However  there are a couple of annoying problems I have had  The first relates to the auto focus and fact that the camera will not shoot a picture if the autofocus says the scene is not in focus and yet it will not find the target at close ranges  so I have to back way up and try it again and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt  Very frustrating THe second problem is a pretty common one  very very short battery life  I don t know why they don t put rechargeable batteries in here and give you a charger  If I m lucky  I can get about 20 shots taken and transferred for each set of 4AA batteries  which is pretty poor br br  
Camera, No doubt  this is one of the best consumer digital cameras that are out there  The camera features both auto and manual modes  I have mostly used the auto function  and sure it takes exceptionally sharp pictures in different light conditions  I have taken some very close up shots and the auto mode handles it very well  The manual mode will give you full control of your shots  It comes with a Lexar 16MB flash card  You can save images in three different modes  Basic  Normal and Fine  With Basic you can get almost 44 images on a 16MB CF  with Normal about 21 images and with Fine about 12 images  One thing I don t like about the camera is it s size  It is a bit too big in size  It is a bit heavy too  I don t like the swivel lens also  You will probably have to use both hands to hold it to take shots  A better alternative would be Nikon Coolpix 880  But as far as camera capabilities and picture quality are concerned this one will be hard to beat     
Camera, I ve been an Internet user for years and have only begun to see the popularity of webcams a year back or so  Everyone and their mother had their grainy pictures plastered in one place or another of this virtual realm  but where was I  Faceless  nowhere to be seen  oh  the drama  Then I bought a webcam so I can do the same  After using that for about a few months  I find webcams to be of somewhat low quality and generally produce pictures that are unattractive  which led to my purchase of the   Fuji FinePix A101    It was a fine choice and soon  I had no use for that pitiful webcam  This digital camera is easy and fun to use and it s also very convenient  The price  one may think  is a very good price   at  150 or so  it sure beats out the other entry level digital cameras in the market    151 In the Box  151  The   Fuji FinePix A101   digital camera comes with the following things to get you set up and ready to go     The camera itself    a silver  lightweight  5 1 oz  photographic device with simple navigational buttons   8 MB SmartMedia Memory Card    a lot to say for something so tiny    USB cable    a short cable to transfer the image and video files into your computer   Software CD ROM    nothing too fancy here  photo transfer printing software and drivers   Instruction manuals    for those who can t figure out how the camera works just by looking at it   Two AA batteries    the ones provided are not very useful  but a nice gesture nonetheless   Wrist strap    needs no description b 151 The Specs  151  b I Fuji FinePix A101   is a  1 3 Mega pixel  camera  and trust me  1 3 Mega pixels is quite enough for everyday pictures  Being rather small with dimensions of  3 9 x 2 5 x 1 6 in I  you can easily fit them into your pocket or purse  The listed specs are  auto exposure  auto manual  6 modes  white balance  4 modes flash system  a fixed focus and 2 0X digital zoom with a focus range of 2 feet to infinity  On the back of the camera is a 1 6 inch color LCD screen for a decent view of the images  For picture quality  you can choose to photograph at 2 resolutions   Fine  at 1280x960 and  Normal  at 640x480  There s also  Basic  in 24 bit color  You can also capture about 20 seconds of video at 320x240 resolution at 10 frames per second  I wouldn t really recommend that since the resolution is fairly poor and there is no sound  There s also an extra feature called the  Fuji Advanced Color Technology   designed give your pictures better color depth and more detail  In addition  the camera easily doubles as a webcam using your USB cable and port Whew   On  to the review    151 What the hell is so great about it   151  I Easy Interface      Fuji FinePix A101   has very user friendly interface  meaning you won t have to wonder what all those buttons are for  Seeing the more advanced digital cameras with a thousand little buttons makes me afraid   what if I pressed something and it breaks  Well  no worries here  Just a quick run through of the manual and a bit of tinkering around will get you comfortable with how the camera works   and you ll be taking pictures in no time   Features    The features are very basic since it s a point and shoot camera  but I ve had no troubles so far with what it has  The pictures rarely come out over  or underexposed and it has a very good focus  The red eye reduction has never been put to use since I haven t had run into that problem  The LCD display is big enough to get a good view of the pictures and  everything just works well    Quality    As far as picture quality goes  the   Fuji FinePix A101   definitely met expectations  As soon as I was out of the electronics store  I started snapping photos of everything I see and went home to view them on my computer  I m no expert at photography  so I don t know much about lighting and exposure and what not  Even the subjects of my pictures tend to be rather stupid  but everything came out bright and highly detailed with beautiful contrast and true to life color  Even at lower resolutions  there wasn t something amiss  You ll be able to fit a lot into a single picture and retain good quality   See bottom of my review for links to sample photos I Software    The camera comes with a software bundle with the required drivers and basic programs to install  For the use of transferring and printing your pictures  they re simple and serve their purpose  There s nothing extra here to titillate  so if you want something advanced  you re on your own   Transfer    The file transfer via the USB cable is quick and painless  taking no more than a minute for the full 8 MB memory card  The pictures are in the common JPEG format  so you ll be able to view and edit them in any photo editing program  When you connect the camera to your computer and turn it on  hehe  the  FinePix Viewer  program will automatically launch to transfer and display your photos  You can then save or delete at your choosing   Memory    The included 8 Megabyte memory card may not seem enough for those who like to take high resolution pictures  but the great thing about digital cameras is that they re film less  Once you ve transferred the pictures to your computer  you can erase the card and use it again  If you prefer to take more than a couple of pictures at a time  I d recommend an upgrade to a 32 MB or 64 MB memory card  Take note that the Fuji FinePix A101 only uses  SmartMedia  memory cards I Extras    If you re looking for more  the   Fuji FinePix A101   can also be used a PC webcam as mentioned earlier  This is especially useful for those who like to broadcast their lives online or videoconference    151 It s not exactly perfect  151  I Battery Life    The problem with digital cameras is that they tend to drain batteries  especially if you frequently use the LCD display  I ve probably used up about  30 worth of batteries to take less than a hundred pictures with the   Fuji FinePix A101    I just wasn t smart enough to get rechargeable ones  So the lesson here  Don t be stupid like me and get rechargeable batteries  but don t forget the charger   Durability    The camera has a light plastic body  which makes it at risk for breaking in the event you drop it or bang it against something  Unfortunately  it doesn t come with a carrying case to protect it  so it s a good idea to get one b 151 I m almost done  151  To bring this review to a conclusion  I d recommend the   Fuji FinePix A101   digital camera to soccer moms and dads  partygoers  novices  students  freaks and geeks  the young and old   anyone who likes to take everyday pictures  Don t expect to get the latest  biggest  baddest technological gadget   because this is not one  It s been out in stores for a while now  but it s still a nice camera that will suit all your basic needs and compete with the rest of them  Thanks for reading november rain b 151 Sample Photos  151  Florida  Disneyworld s Epcot Center  http image1ex

Camera, It s without doubt the best digital camera I ever had or tested in this price range  It couldn t get better  The optical zoom makes it better then most digital cameras  The bonus is that it can record a sequence of film and sound  Not so useful but fun if you don t want to bring a DV camera to a party or event  It looks and feels and operates like a  quot real quot  camera  It also has a  quot macro lens quot  useful when you want to take a picture of a small thing like a butterfly  Like all other digital cameras the only thing you have to think about is that if you take a close up you should use the display to focus since you don t look through the lens  The camera is comfortable to hold and doesn t weigh much  I have dropped mine a few times without anything happening to it  The look and feel is great and the pictures are even better  It s worth all the extra money it costs  It s so much better than all other digital cameras that aren t professional  You can t get a better camera for the same price br br  
Camera, Well i am parshall to this camera because i own one  For people who do not need to take movie clips and who are novices at digital photography then this is the camera for them  Sony doesn t skimp you on anything for the cheapo price  Unfortunently I paid  499 for mine instead of the listed price they have on this site  In fact everywhere I have seen them they have been priced  499  The thing that caught my attention on this camera is that it has a 3 1 2 floppy drive built in to the camera  instead of the flash slots in other digital cameras  This means when the disk is full you just pop it out and pop in another one  instead of finding a computer to download the pictures on from the flash card  It has a LCD screen on the back along with many other functions such as picture effect like Black and white  Negative Art  and Sepia which looks like the old western pictures  Other functions include flash options  10x zoom  and what type of file you want to save the picture in  Another thing I love about this camera is that it allows you to see the picture you just took and if you don t like it you can delete it right then and there so it doesn t take up space  Some of its downfalls though is that it s a little bulky and the weight is moderate  It also has auto focus so you don t have to worry about the clarity of the pictures  When the battery is dead it only takes about an hour to recharge to full capacity  Over all i give it a 4 out of 5 br br  
Camera, The Canon Elph S230 is a small  solid point shoot digital camera that is for you if you re looking to take photos without any hassle  It s the first camera in that size from Canon to sport a 3 2 megapixel CCD  enough to print reasonable quality 8x10 prints on a photo quality inkjet printer at 2400 dpi It sports a 2x optical zoom  never pay attention to the digital zoom it just makes your photos look really grainy  and has an advanced AiAF auto focusing system  This just means that your photos look sharp and always in focus if you take them when there is plenty of sunlight  this system does a much better job than anything Canon or any other digital camera manufacturer has released to date Because of its simple design  the manual controls on the camera are limited  You can set a couple different flash modes  on off red eye night time  the shutter speed  and the light sensitivity setting  ISO 100 400  but beyond that  the lens is always in automatic mode  You can t set the aperature  nor can you tinker with other settings that can give you full control of the shot   Thus  you can t play around with depth of field or do anything else artistic if you re looking to do some serious amateur photography  One additional gripe  because the lens element is so small  low light or indoor photos are really blurry and grainy  more so than other digital cameras  The flash is also somewhat weak  if you re 3 feet away from the person you ll be able to see him clearly but anything beyond that gets really dark and fuzzy Ok  enough of the techno talk onto looking at the user experience  Some thoughts 1  The camera is really easy to use  and the controls are rather intuitive  The setting buttons are small and sometimes hard to press  but then again  the camera is small I m not one to complain 2  Changing photo options often requires that you go into a menu system  While it works  I prefer a camera where I can press a button to access that particular option rather than having to navigate through a couple of menus 3  Taking a photo is a snap  just point  shoot  and the camera does the rest  The AiAf feature and other intelligent controls help figure out all the details  focus  matrixing  etc  for you so you don t have to deal with that 4  The photos come out really nice  it s comparable to larger  more expensive digital cameras  except  as I mentioned previously  in low light or indoor conditions where the small lens element makes the photos a bit more fuzzy than it otherwise needs to be In any case  I m happy with the camera  The best thing about it is it s extremely portable  just slip it in your pocket and you won t feel a thing  
Auto, The Olds Silhouette is a good smooth driving  good looking vehicle  We would buy another one  but would consider putting in my own battery and buying better tires We like our Silhouette  but are disgusted with GM for the inferior quality accessories  In less than 18 months  we have had to replace the tires and the battery  I have been driving for over 35 years and have never had this kind of luck with tires or a battery  Within a two week period when the car was 15 months old and had approximately 25 000 miles on it  I had problems with 3 different tires  The first time I replaced only the single tire  When the second tire went flat  I asked the Goodyear dealer to check all of my tires  At that time he found and identified to me  the damage suffered by that tire  as well as a second tire  My only choice was to replace the remaining tires  So at that point I had replaced all 4 tires on my vehicle  In all of my years I have had very few problems with tires  and particularly when they were relatively new  The Goodyear dealer told me that these were inferior quality tires  I would have to agree with him  Then in our month 18 of our vehicle s life  we started noticing some electrical problems  We were not carrying our charge in the battery  Plus we were having lighting problems  as if the switches were shorting out  We took this to our Olds dealer and he told us that our battery was leaking and had leaked acid on some of our wiring  Of course  none of this was covered by our extended warranty that we had purchased  When I checked into the history of problems with Oldsmobile vehicles I found that most of their tires and batteries must be replaced relatively early in their life  Obviously Olds purchases large lots of very inferior products to put into their new vehicles  This angers me and that is why I am writing  We like the Silhouette  and will likely replace this one with another  But  if we do  I will time it so that I can keep the tires and the battery on my current vehicle  I don t want any more of their sub quality products in my car br br  
Auto, I bought my  97 Passat new  feeling like I was back in a family friend  My father had had 4 VWs when I was a child  and had put over 300 000 miles on his 1977 Rabbit  At first I really liked my Passat  except lots of little things kept breaking off or going wrong   for example I shut the door with a window down and the regulator broke  at  348 to repair  and then the replacement broke 3 weeks later  At least the dealer honored the 1 year warranty on parts and labor  The cupholders are fragile and broke a couple of times as well  stuff like that At 34 000 miles the air conditioning went out  and I was quoted  2400 for repair    1650 for parts and  750 for labor  since the whole dashboard would have to come out  Needless to say  it remained unrepaired  Around the same time it developed a severe drinking problem  burning oil like crazy  The dealer tried to tell me that burning up to one quart of oil per 1000 miles was normal  but could never explain why it had not done that for the first 4 years I had owned it  The oil problem got worse and worse and finally the dealer had to fix it  something to do with a compression problem on cylinder 6  under the original owner 100 000 mile 10 year warranty  Interesting that they no longer offer that on the new models  Engine check lights would go on and they would charge me  400    700 each time for some obscure valve  and then the light would go on again  always with a different problem  The dealer is very expensive to use but very few other places work on VWs   there are BMW and Mercedes and Porsche mechanics all over  but not a lot of VW shops  Parts are not cheap  either  And tires  be aware that they use a high performance tire not often kept in stock that only lasts about 30 000 miles and costs  199 each to replace  149 if you can find a sale About 1 month ago  at 56 950 miles  with almost exactly 6 years of service and extremely loving and diligent care  the car threw a rod  The engine was of course  completely destroyed  The dealer again had to fix it under the warranty  but by now I had had enough  As soon as I got it back I traded it for a new Honda  I am bitterly disappointed but will never buy a VW again  
Camera, INTRO  Cameras suffer from the problem of  moores law  which essentially mean that they are advancing quickly and every few years or so  your camera will go into obsolecense  Which is why  like with my computer purchases  I go with the standard  1 rule  I buy what is currently the standard in quality performance  but one step up  Usually this has treated me better than trying to buy cutting bleeding edge technology which cameras suffer greatly from INITIAL Right off I was happy  It takes great 4 0 Megapixel pictures in automatic mode  has a handy little folding LCD which I thought would be useless  but is actually pretty awesome for self portraits and other interesting shots  still life  The camera uses AA batteries which  though more practical if you travel  can be annoying in regards to battery life  The zoom is 3x and had a digital zoom  which I will probably never use  I haven t used all the features yet  since I have had the camera for only a few weeks  USING IT The quality is great  and the prints that turn out also  The color is usually right on  except in low light situations  The 3x zoom doesn t allow for much flexibility  I haven t tried the digital zoom  The camera is VERY feature rich  and I am already enjoying shooting in manual mode  you can control the aperture and speed with the VERY ergonomic controls  and even the flash power can be set which I enjoyed  The software that came with the camera is actually pretty good  though you cant do much in the way of editing  32MB card that is provided is barely adequate for much  but it s nice to have as an extra  I bought a 256MB card  and it s fine for our needs  The batteries don t last long naturally  especially with using the flash  so rechargables are a must  It would have been nice if the camera came with the AC adapter  so at least you aren t killing the batteries when you are downloading pictures to the computer  Speed is pretty good  I like the autofocus  The viewfinder is also nice  and zooms when you zoom The small LCD is both a con and a pro  it saves battery life  but it s also hard to tell whether a shot is good or not  
Camera, We bought the  Polaroid Photo Max PDC 640  for Christmas last year  It took us until August to get the camera hooked up to our computer  I called Tech Support on several occasions and they were not much help We ended up having to buy the San Disk Flash Path Floppy Disk Adapter  This had us up and running with the camera in a matter of five minutes  I was relieved at last that I could finally use my camera with ease The  Polaroid Photo Max PDC 640  takes great pictures  The pixel quality is not the greatest  but for an inexpensive camera it is good  The  Polaroid Photo Max PDC 640  is simple to use  We were pointing and shooting in 15 minutes  We have hooked the  Polaroid Photo Max PDC 640  up to our TV to view the pictures and they come out crisp and clean  The camera comes with three settings of picture quality  Each one has lower pixels but the ability to take more pictures  The minimum amount of pictures is 24 the maximum is 96  I have found that setting it on the middle setting works for us Smart Media is now selling memory cards so you can increase the amount of pictures you can take with the  Polaroid Photo Max PDC 640   This is great if you want to take the camera on vacation with you  If you will not have access to a computer to download the pictures an extra memory card will help you out If you have a computer and plan to download pictures good luck this is no easy task  I would recommend purchasing the floppy disk adapter it would make life a lot easier  The battery life is extremely short if you view the pictures the back of the camera  I would not recommend product to the beginner br br  
Auto, I bought a new ford ranger standard cab  2 1 2 years ago  I have taken a few long trips in this vehicle and have found for long trips it is a little uncomfortable  as far as dependability it has been a very dependable truck  I have not had any major problems with this truck other than just one small irritating problem  my inside light does not turn off after the door is shut  It gets very good gas mileage and rides well     
Camera, How would you like to surprise your loved ones this time of the year  You can do so with a simple present that will speak volume  If you are living the American dream  you are like the rest of us  with parents scattered all over the states and the globe  Staying in touch with them becomes more and more urgent especially when the grandkids start asking questions about grandpa and grandma  Digital photography has come to shorten that great distance  Extended families can remain abreast of their loved ones  news and progress   Minolta F100 Zoom Digital Camera  is the right camera that can help family members to bond once again  With the popularity of e mail and customized web albums  this camera is the right addition to the family s set of equipment  In my interaction with my friends and some customers who ask me for assistance  I have never hesitated to let them know that their needs should justify the purchase of a specific camera b Why should anybody invest in this camera b Well  if you are looking for superior performance and style  then you d better go with the best on the market  There again  it s all relative to your needs  If you are only a beginner  obviously your needs will be drastically different from those of a professional or an intermediate user  They may need to get some specific results  Don t let the preceding statements fool you when it comes to which cameras to use to e mail pictures to your loved ones or post them on your sites  All digital cameras can meet this basic need  The Minolta Dimage F100 comes loaded with 4 megapixels  For sure  your pictures will have a higher resolution  Keep in mind that the higher the resolution  the more megapixels are in use  the sharper the image will be when blown up to larger and larger sizes  When we are talking about low resolution  we mostly see cameras with less than a megapixel  Don t fall into that trap  Buy a camera you can be proud of for some time  The Minolta Dimage F100 is one of the top cameras on the market right now  It can give you superb quality pictures  With 4 megapixels  your images can only be great even after you do all the editing  cropping etc  The chance is that these images will still look great  The DiMage F100 is one of Minolta s best outputs so far  No matter what your current status is  you will find great joy using it for your various work related and home projects  So far  all I have heard from my friends and customers who have used it is just praise for its standard features b What are some of the features you will fall for in this camera b Using a PC platform  the Minolta DiMage can be used to record movies  Fortunately  it uses the Lithium Ion batteries which can last much longer  In fact  they are the best batteries you can get on the market right now  It has a storage capacity of 16 MB  It s already a given that this camera has a very high resolution  A very important feature that all buyers should care about is the difference between   optical and digital zoom    It all comes down to the optical zoom being the better of the two due to the fact that in a camera such the Minolta DiMage F100 or any other one is like zooming in a film camera  When you zoom  the image quality or resolution of the object is preserved  The DiMage F100 uses 3x optical zoom 2 5x digital zoom and movie mode with sound  It s a combination of the two features that will ultimately produce great images b Where can you catch the action  Are you ready to take a few snapshots b i Point and shoot  With an affordable camera such as the DiMage F100  you can take images of your active life  You can share the precious moments of your working life with others all over the world  If you live on a farm  take pictures of your animals  livestock  poultry  cattle or the fruits from your orchards and the beautiful roses of your gardens  Just take the pictures  download them into your computer  get down to the editing room whenever you have some time and get ready to e mail or post them  For sure  the Minolta can reduce distance  If your kids don t stay in touch with their grandparents living on the other coast  it s not due to the lack of technology  You can take it a few steps further by investing in webcams  With the Minolta DiMage  you can be sure to always refresh  update pictures on your small business web page  LCD display  Disk Media Type  Secure digital Multimedia b Would it make a good present idea b If you want to give to give a memorable present this holiday season  you invest in this camera  Its recipient will be grateful to you for your generosity  
Auto, If you have the money to consider an XKR  you are shouldn t be too concerned about it s impractical aspects  insurance cost  tiny backseat  poor gas mileage  Despite this  in nice climates this car can be close to an everyday use vehicle without worry Maintenance is only required every 10 000 miles including oil changes  The transmission is a 100 000 maintenance item  This all adds up to minimal time wasted at the dealer It has a very large gas tank  which is useful considering the below average gas mileage  However  the gas mileage is reasonable so long as you don t gun it  run it in low gears all the time  and keep the sport mode off Of course  every once in awhile you ll want to see what it can do  and it will not disappoint  The Pirelli P Zero standard tires really grip the road  but only get 13000 18000 miles depending on how aggresively you drive  A specialized computer adjusts the suspension and reaction of the steering wheel based on speed in a very natural way   so natural that you won t notice it until you drive another car It s highly adjustable seats and high powered stereo system that includes an 8  subwoofer sound great  and make it a pleasure to drive on long trips In 18000 miles over a 1 75 year period  I had one mechanical problem   a loose gasket causing a slow transmission fluid drip  It was repaired under warranty the same day  and I was given a free S Type rental car by the dealer The back seat works for kids  but adults are forced to sit sideways  And of course  the trunk is ideal for a couple golf bags but not a whole lot more The optional GPS system is really great  with many nice features including recently visited address recall and search functions to find the closest bank  grocery store  jaguar dealer  restaurant  and many other points of interest  
Camera, Every so often a product pops up that sets the standard for its time  In camcorders  it was Sony s TRV900  still manufactured and still highly sought after  and for digital cameras the Canon G1 G2 cameras have garnered the same kind of devotion from their owners and kudos from reviewers  That s one nice thing you ll certainly discover as you research this camera  and at almost  800 dollars  I m certain you re doing plenty of research  there are hundreds of owners  reviews and samples from the G2 to be found on the net  As G2 owner  I m happy to throw my own support behind the camera  Surf  research  compare   I did  And three weeks down the road I decided the G2 was the camera to buy Your first 2 stops on the web researching the camera will probably be Phil Askey s review at the Digital Photography website www dpreview com reviews canong2  This is a very detailed review and worth referring back to again and again  but let me sum it up for you  Phil considers the Canon G2  as of summer 2002   the benchmark  in consumer digital cameras  Now you can spend more than  2 000 dollars and get better  but for the average person the G2 s price is already asking a lot  So Phil s calling the G2 a  benchmarK  is completely fair at this price point  Simply put  He gives it the  highly recommended  rating it deserves Your next stop will probably be Steve s Digicams   www steves digicams com 2001 reviews g2 html  While Steve s reviews aren t quite as intensive and his summaries not as informative  a bit of a balancing act neither here nor there  the site is of great interest if you agree that  seeing is believing  when choosing a camera  Steve s photo samples spelled it out very clearly to me and led me to pick the G2 because of its samples  the G2 takes wonderfully detailed  sharp  yet expressive photos You may wonder why I say  sharp  yet expressive  photos  Having worked for 12 years as a professional photographer you get to know the  character  of different lenses  Nikon lenses  for example are remarkable sharp but also  flat  in that they add little atmospherics to a photograph  I always felt portraits looked rather cold through a Nikon lens  A perfect example of a  Nikon shot  would be a sports photo   sharp  focused but a little clinical  Many great photographers swear by Leica camera  and their lenses are what I consider  expressive  They are also focused and clear  but they also lend an gorgeous touch of  romance  or photographic  timelessness  to a picture  Look at the work of the world s great photographers and you ll see what I mean  Unfortunately Lecias rangefinders are expensive cameras and take time to operate to perfection   not for novices  Now  in my experience   which has included Nikon  Olympus  Pentax  Canon and Leica  I found that Canon lenses are a happy medium  Offering both the clarity of Nikon lenses  but a touch of that  classic look  magic  That was another reason I became so enamoured of the G2  it has the wonderful Canon lens look  and unlike many other cameras  Canon manufactures the lens for the G2 itself  If you want to take family portraits or give photojournalism a try  the G2 s optics will serve you wonderfully Techically  it s a brillant piece of work  Not it s not as responsive as an SLR  but when you add autofocus and exposure things always tend to lag a bit  And the fact that the G2 is a pocket camera  more or less  it certainly isn t the handful a full sized SLR presents  lets you accept this  lag time  shortcoming for the wonderful job it does thinking for you  On the practical side  its Lithium Ion battery is a lifesaver  It s the same battery used in Canon D30  2 400  camera  If you ve pondered the question which is better   using AA batteries or a proprietry battery   the answer is Lithium batteries charge fast  last forever and don t suffer from any memory effects  I ve shot 40 50 photos a day for 3 days straight and haven t put a dent in my battery  You can carry this on an extended weekend trip and leave the charger at home  It s a fantasic power system  and leaves regular batteries in the dust Okay  but why should I spend almost  800 on a camera  Well  if you re a  350 a week man with a family and no saving  don t  If you think you can afford it  you ll find your old love  or a new love  for taking photographs blossoming  Film developing and printing costs are a thing of the past  if you have a computer and a printer  which I trust you do if you re considering a digicam  and you can shoot  shoot  shoot without worrying about running out of exposures  and erasing what you don t like along the way  I recently was talking with Time magazine photographer and gushing over a photo essay he did in the salt fields of India  I asked him what kind of photo paper he printed on in the darkroom and he said   I havent  been in the darkroom in three years  I do them on my computer and with an Epson printer  That s when I began looking for my digital camera The Downside Well  as I ve said  I m finicky and I ve found I m only happy with photos printed at 300dpi  On 4 megabite cameras that allow me a size up to about 5 5 x7 75  inches  which make for nice display around the home  but precludes really taking gallery sized photos  Some people say they have gotten great 8X10 or 11X14s from the camera  I just don t see it happening  or at least not to my eye Also  my only non  5  rating for the camera has to do with construction   800 is a steep price for a camera and expecting all metal construction would not have been out of line at this price point  Minus one for its body  In other words  don t drop it  Of course I never dropped one in all my years shooting  so don t fret it  Just remember  its a CAMERA   they re fragile On final point  this camera is not a WYSIWYG through the viewfinder SLR  You can compose your photo using the camera s LCD screen  absolutely fine to use  but if you re an old photo buff and insist on looking through the viewfinder  which I do  you ll definitely miss there not being any exposure  speed  etc  information displayed there  That information is only available on the LCD screen  So to change your shutter speed or F stop  you ll have to use the LCD screen  This bugged me at first  but I learned to live with it fast  It s really not a problem The Verdict I love the G2  It s a little photographic miracle  as is everything about digital photography  and I heartily recommend the camera  Like I ve said  there s a big support group of happy owners out there who ll agree with me on that   and that s what makes a classic  If you find the motivation  and the money  you won t be disappointed and the solidity of this well made camera will have you cradling it like a new love  If you just want to  point and shoot    you ll be amazed the shots you ll get with the G2  some photos I took this weekend really took me by surprise with their quality  If you re more experienced  you ll have a ball finding out what the camera is capable of  My last recommendation  Take A LOT of picture of the kids quick and show them to your wife   you ll be out of the dog house fast that way when she sees the beauty of the G2 s photos  
Camera, My day job is as an I S  Administrator  I was sent on a mission to investigate digital cameras for my company  The company is a mortgage lender for agricultural properties  There are currently 12 people who take pictures of properties as part of their jobs as Appraisers  They asked for a camera that would 1  take the pictures they wanted  2  make it easy to get to those pictures and 3  make it easy to get those pictures into portfolios for use by loan officers Chief Officers and other appraisers  I tried out 7 cameras and this is the one I recommended  The primary reason for my recommendation is the 3 5 quot  floppy access  Take the picture  take the floppy out and insert it into any 3 5 quot  floppy drive  by the way  ALL computers have a floppy drive and then double click on the JPG file on the floppy  THAT S IT  No software to load  No dongles or serial cables to install  No special attachments to worry about  No special media to carry pictures on  Smart Flash cards  You see  what everyone is looking for is ease of application  Not all computers have the download software on them  Not all computers have a serial download cable available  Not all computers can read smart media  BUT   All computers have a floppy drive  ALL computers come with image software to look at pictures  IE3 01 or greater  And the camera makes disk copies all by itself so you can share with friends  This is the ONLY way to go regarding digital cameras  as long as you don t need special graphics br br  
Auto, This review is all about attitude  If you re looking to buy a Lincoln Mark VII you can get all the tech specs and cold  hard numbers you want on this car  But screw that what you really want to hear about is what this car is all about  Attitude  baby The Lincoln Mark VII LSC makes no apologies for what it is  Politically correct  minivan driving  Starbucks swilling yuppies be damned this car thumbs its nose at everything held precious by today s soccer moms and dot com dads  It s a relic of Reaganomics  A standing tall  shining city on a hill  All Amurrican kind of vehicle  Viewed from head on with its front wheels turned to a rakish angle  it looks you right in the eye and says   quot If you don t like it  then stick it up your tailpipe quot  And  like the outspoken governor of Minnesota  it has the muscle to go with the attitude Gawd  I love this car I ve loved this car since it first hit the streets in 1984  For the next few years I could only dream of owning one  but today I can look back and count four that I ve owned  including two currently  In its first two model years  the Mark s makers put more emphasis on luxury and leather than sportiness  But beginning in 1986  with the LSC sport coupe leading the way  the Mark VII found its groove with a pumped up 5 0 liter V8  same as the Mustang GT  improved suspension and steering  dual exhaust  performance rear end  etc  etc  etc Ford kept pouring on the power until the  quot VII quot  was replaced with the  quot VIII quot  in 1993 and the end of an era for those of us who believe this to be the best looking luxury coupe ever produced  For the lead footed folks  the pinnacle of Mark VII attitude was the SE model  a sinister looking  nearly chrome free version of the LSC series  It came in black or red  but black was the color of choice for this brute in velvet gloves The Mark VII was also a test bed for Ford s leading technology of the eighties  As a result  the cockpit is chock full of buttons  lights  buzzers and chimes  The car rides on four air bags instead of coil springs and uses a unique German made anti lock brake system  Features like these promote a love hate relationship with current owners who must get down in the technical trenches or shell out big bucks for repairs  Most owners  however  would agree that the Mark VII is very reliable   even when rolling through the second hundred thousand miles   but when things do break  they re expensive The upside to all this is that the cars are relatively cheap to buy  But if you do  consider the purchase price as a down payment and go into it knowing you will have to cough up more down the road  But don t let it scare you away  my Marks have delivered many thousands of low cost miles to me over the years  Besides  if you would actually consider buying a Camry or some other faceless  econo clone man  you re in the wrong place So get behind the wheel of an LSC and hey  whaddayou lookin at     
Auto, Well the 222 horsepower Maxima raises another question  How much hp can you shove in to an ugly exterior  Quite a few as it turns out  Anyway  I personally dont like the exterior body design  It is practically the same as the years before with the exception of the slightly modified rear lights  The interior is quite nice with the full leather interior option  But what car isn t nice with full interior  Forgive me for not liking this car  By all means its a good car as far as speed and luxury combined  But still not good enough to live up to its 26k loaded sticker price tag  However they managed to put 22 more horsepower in to that small v6 engine and still get 25mpg which I am quite impressed with seeing as how gas prices seem to keep going up  Anyway my overall verdict is Solid car  Very nice interior  Good enough speed  But ugly body design and lack of thought for the body design br br  
Auto, I looked at several vehicles before making the decision to get out of my Nissan lease early  thank the powers above I looked at the Saturn LS  Dodge Stratus  and all of the Hondas  I decided on the Cougar for several reasons Back in November of 1999  my fiancee was looking at a new car  In Maxim  they had a picture of all of the 2000s  and the Cougar stood out on the page  She thought it was not practical enough for her  so she got a Civic  nice car This past month  I went car shopping and the Cougar was the last car I looked at  The Stratus was close  but I decided to take the Cougar considering it was less money and my fiancee had a 4 door car  Being only in the second week  I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE First off  the Mercury dealer was the most honest  The Dodge dealers were kind of shady  and the Saturn did not allow me to haggle the price  although they did offer me some sort of money off  Also  the Mercury drove well and I just loved the little computer with all that information I got a fantastic deal on my car  It was fully loaded except for leather  sunroof  and CD changer  I paid just over  17 000 with all of these dealer incentives  I got the  quot laser red quot  color The car is a headturner  People stair at my car  It looks a lot more expensive than the price  With the wide tires and cool rims  people are always gazing at the car  The front with the sleek hood design and the rear with the spoiler and shaped tail are freaking cool  Plus  the side designs are narly as well OK  so as you can tell  I love this car  The only real negative with this car is the small back seat  While the bucket seats in the back look nice  there are not too many people that can sit back there  Also  the radio could be a little more user friendly I would tell everyone that is looking for a reasonably priced sports car to jump on this cat  It is well worth the price   
Auto, The 1994 Lincoln Mark VIII is the best car I have ever owned  It is expensive when brand new  but if you buy one that s 3 to 5 years old  you can get a great deal  Lincoln makes a fine product and they stand behind it with the best service departments that I ve ever dealt with  The Mark VIII is a sharp looking 2 door coupe with sleek styling  Once inside  you ll notice that it has all the  quot creature comforts quot  The fully adjustable seats with lumbar support make long drives a pleasure  The air ride system makes it glide down the road  The JBL sound system is engineered specifically for this car and it s the nicest sounding factory system I ve heard  The engine is a quiet giant  Do not be fooled by the number 4 6   this 4 6 liter engine puts out 285 horsepower and whiplash torque  I had a Mustang GT before and this Lincoln will blow it away  It does require premium fuel and the engine will  quot talk quot  to you when you get poor quality fuel or when you are just too cheap to put in the good stuff br br  
Camera, O k  here is the deal  I have two cameras  the  150 Umax Astracam 1800  1 3MP  and the  500 Ricoh RDC 7  3 2 MP  Both cameras are not mainstream  but cool if you taker a closer look  They are both small and give good pictures  Here is why I like the Umax 1800  It is the one camera that is easily available to take spur of the moment shots  It powers on very quickly  less than 2 sec  and the total time from power on to  picture taken  is  timed  3 5 4 seconds  Since the camera is very plain  no additional settings need to be taken care of  and yet it takes great pictures over a wide variety of conditions  Definitely more fun than a film based camera  especially in low light  Also  it runs off only two AA s  The lack of a preview LCD screen is not too bad  it saves energy  camera lasts very long on NiMH s  and it also saves time  So when it comes to taking a quick snap  the Umax 1800 is often my preferred camera  I use the Ricoh when I have more time and want better pictures and control  but the Ricoh takes a long time to capture the shot  Ricoh RDC 7  Take out of protective carrying case  it s expensive  so I keep it in there  take off lens cap  longer power on due to zoom   AF lens  open up fold away LCD  align camera so desired picture appears on LCD  then shoot  longer delay b c of AF  Also  the many controls entice you to  optimize  exposure etc  before the shot  taking away even more time  Umax 1800  Power on  glance through optical viewfinder  shoot  Get decent pictures on almost any occasion  So  in light of the recent appreciation that I discovered for my cheap Umax 1800  I decided to give it a positive review  It s better than you might think  I definitely wouldn t want to miss it  Other reviews  http www pcworld com reviews article asp aid 18905 http www neoseeker com Hardware Products Umax AstraCam1800 I once posted a few nice shots  great twilight capability  but I can t find them online anymore  Lost in the web

Auto, Well  not a whole lot  to be honest  I ve always driven trucks or SUV s  and I was very reluctant about buying a car  You see  I m very short  This may sound unrelated  but I m just over 5 feet tall  and I never really liked the idea of being so close to the ground while I drove  Whenever I was forced to drive a car when my car was in the shop or being used by someone else  I always felt like I was driving a go cart So  when I recently decided to trade in my Explorer for something more fuel efficient  I figured I d stay with Ford and go for a Taurus  I purchased the Taurus LES  the luxury model  complete with leather interior and climate control  And I have to tell you  it s been absolutely incredible  Apparently  Ford has been working on the new design for the Taurus for somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 years  Although I m still closer to the ground than I d like  this model is much better than my mother s 1996 Taurus  The car rides much smoother than my Explorer ever did  and it s much more fuel efficient  So  if there is anyone out there who s been hit as hard by the gas price hike and is nervous about buying a car  I d highly recommend this beautiful  economical car     
Camera, I bought a Fuji FinePix 1300 some four months back  Thought of sharing my views and experience with the same Let me talk about the Pros first  Fuji is my first digital camera and I found it very easy to use it  The buttons and knobs for various controls are designed perfectly  Without reading the manual itself  we can start operating the camera Size is really good and it can be kept inside our shirt pocket  So carrying and handling it is really simple The picture quality is good  That much only can be expected from a 1 3 Mega pixel camera  The USB is really good and is very fast  I could download my pictures in 10 seconds time  The software that comes with the camera is good and easy to use Now let me come to the cons  Battery   4 numbers are required  The camera is very hungry always and eats my battery power like anything  So without rechargeable batteries we cannot feed the camera  LCD is very small and is dull  The picture quality in the computer screen and the one in the camera screen are very much different in terms of quality  Compatibility with various operating systems  I had to struggle with my computer to install the USB driver  It will not work in many old Win versions and few latest too  So buyers be careful about this point Let me conclude by telling that  this camera is a good choice for a starter whose main use of digital pictures is to put in web pages or sending them to their loved ones Say Cheese   
Camera, Overview I originally bought this camera as a  portable  addition to my Nikon SLR camera  Instead  I have purchased a complete replacement to the much bigger Nikon SLR  I bought this camera from Amazon com in 11 2001 for  399 with free shipping and a rebate that included a sling bag  a 16MB CF Card  and an extra battery in addition to the standard camera package Of course  the camera takes excellent pictures both indoor and outdoors  But  the main feature of this camera is it s great SIZE  This camera is so small that I take it EVERYWHERE  And I don t look like a nerd doing so  I think that I actually look sort of cool  Since upgrading from my SLR  I ve been able to capture so much more of my adventures on film The camera supports the main features that I was interested in  Black   White photos  Hi Resolution Color photos  2 1MPix is perfectly suitable for 8 10 prints  movies with sound  great software  etc CONNECTION TO THE COMPUTER Before buying digital  I was concerned that the interface between my Canon and the computer would quickly become obsolete  This  however is not the case  Any computer  running any version of Windows with USB will be able to support this camera  If USB becomes obsolete  then you ll merely have to purchase a Compact Flash card reader that connects to the computer via another interface like Firewire  SOFTWARE The software bundled with this camera is pretty good  Installation was easy  Downloading photos and movies onto the computer is very  very easy  Organizing the photos on my computer  keep in mind that you ll soon have hundreds or even thousands of pictures to manage  is easy  They supply software that will allow you to digitally enhance your photos or movies  They also supply an interesting piece of software called Photostitch I wish that the camera shipped with Adobe Photoshop  but that program alone probably costs  500 700  Photostitch software allows you to digitally combine multiple images to form one giant  panoramic  perhaps  image  I took a series of about 9 beautiful pictures of this coastal town and digitally  stitched  them together using this software  The picture looks amazing  The camera also supports panoramic shots through one of its shooting modes  When used with Photostitch  the results are fantastic MEMORY The camera ships with a wimpy 8MB CF card  While this is suitable to get up and running with the camera  I d recommend immediately buying the most memory that you can afford  The camera supports any size Type I Compact Flash card  I recently bought a 256MB CF card and have had superior results  I can store approximately 260 of the highest quality images  or literally thousands of lower quality images Keep in mind that a top quality 2 1 Mpixel image takes about 1MB worth of memory  If you use a higher Mpixel camera  you ll need more memory  Luckily  memory prices are dropping FAST  so we ll all soon be able to take as many pictures as we want MOVIES The movies have turned out to be a very  very fun addition to this camera  Regardless of the size of the CF card  the S110 only allows you to take 5 7second  highest res  15 sec  medium res  or 30 second  low resolution  movies  It s really been a blast taking both black and white  and color movies  Unlike some cameras  the movies DO have sound  The sound is pretty good  When viewed on the computer  the movies look great  When viewed directly on the TV through the supplied video cable the movies look a little choppy  presumably because of their large size TV CONNECTION Saying that  it s been fun hooking the S110 up to the TV  Just plug the camera into the cable and you can have a slideshow on any TV  This has been fun as I rent a ski house with a bunch of people  At the end of the weekends we plug in the camera and run through the pictures  BATTERY LIFE The battery comes with a rapid charger  Use the battery for about 150 170 shots with the flash and it ll be totally depleted  Note that these high quality batteries do not need to be fully drained before recharging them  I got the rebate offer for a free battery   but I only sent in the form about 3 weeks ago so hopefully I ll see another battery soon  OTHER NICETIES The camera will take pictures using a timer  Press the trigger and wait for about 10 seconds before the picture is taken  I also bought a nice  very inexpensive  5  tripod that screws into the tripod holder  The tripod has three flexible 5  legs  The legs are flexible  and thus the camera can be mounted anywhere  When you are done with the tripod simply straighten out the legs  unscrew the tripod  and put the tripod in your pocket  
Camera, The product was exciting to me because I can take a picture and use it immediately  It can be reviewed on the screen and this allows you to get those once in a lifetime shots the way that you want  The movie option that allows a full minute of digital video was the key to my purchase  I have family all over the country and I now can include them in the fun of all the special family occasions when they happen  Floppies can be copied in the machine for multi use by all  The unit comes with a 90 minute battery  charger  software  free web storage amp  video cable for your television  The unit is ready to go out of the box  making it a terrific gift  open it first to get the rest of the party br br  
Auto, Ever went to purchase a vehicle and you wanted a family car and your spouse wanted a truck  Well Ford has done it  It is the Explorer Sport Trac  It is a combination of both  There is enough room inside for a family but then has a bed like a truck  Once we test drove this we knew that we had to have it  So that s what happened  we got us one  This has been one of the best vehicles that we have ever purchased  Besides being a combination car and truck it has many more unique qualities  Have you ever had to move and were worried about scratching or denting the bed of your truck  Well your worries are over  This truck has a guaranteed bed  It will never ding  dent or rust  Trust me it sounds like a gimmick  but I have tested it and know that it is all the truth  We recently helped family move and my husband had a tow bar in the bed  This thing was sliding all around  Every time that we slammed on the brakes it would hit the back of the bed and I thought there is no way that this bed is going to make it through this  Well  it did it  There was not one scratch ding or dent in the entire bed  Also  there is an extra electrical outlet in the bed of the truck  This is great for trailers  power tools and camping  It came with a hard top cover  The Explorer Sport Trac came equipped with a V 6  But it feels like it is a V 8  It is fully loaded  Electrical mirrors  windows  locks and driver seats  There are leather seats There is an overhead counsel that indicates direction and the temperature  It will also let you know of sever conditions outside  Such as icy roads or extreme heat  There is also a rear control panel for the back seat passengers  It lets you control the heat  fan  and radio from the back seat  I think that this vehicle is perfect for everyone  Weather you are looking for a family car or a sporty little truck  you have found the perfect one     
Auto, Okay  my car isn t a 99  It s a 96  The reason I am posting  though  is that I feel my opinion is valuable since I have been driving this car for a long time  I can be a good judge on how reliable it is Our family is not the type to trade a car off every two years  we drive a car until the wheels fall off or the motor blows up  In the ten years we have been married  my husband and I have only bought one new car a 1996 Chevy Geo Metro  It is a white four door  It has a low sloped front end and a high seated rear end  making the car resemble an egg  hence the nickname  quot Egg mobile quot  The car has changed very little since 1996  except Chevrolet has dropped the  quot Geo quot  line  This car has been very dependable  We rely on this little car everyday as the family car and work car  For years my husband drove it about  50 miles one way to work  We have taken it on many long trips  It has never  knock on wood  given us any problems  We have never had the car in the shop for anything besides routine maintanince  oil changes  tires  breaks  ect  It starts everytime we turn the key  and it gets us where we want to go  no muss  no fuss  thank you very much The car is a Geo  and it has a little engine  This is great for gas millage  and bad for power  My 1988 Toyota Tercel has alot more power  and it has engine problems  But  turn off the air conditioner  put the pedal to the floor  and the car will pass in good time The other complaint I have about this car is that it has a small back window and a high trunk  which makes it difficult to judge distance while passing or driving in reverse  It also only seats four  This is good when you are a family of four  but bad when you want to take Nana along for the ride This car will be paid off later this year  We plan on trading in the Tercel for a larger car  My husband plans on giving me the new car and keeping the Geo to drive to work  He has always claimed the newer car  but this time I think he s attatched  You know how men are about their cars br br  
Auto, i bought my 1997 jetta  quot jazz quot  edition used a few months back  i am thoroughly in love with the car  i prefer the pre 1999 jetta to the current model  because of it s distinctive vw look  it has the classic boxy look that dates back to the first rabbits and dashers of the mid 70s  my girlfriends grandfather  in fact  commented that it looked like an updated version of his  77 dasher while some say the automatic transmission  4cylinder combo lacks pick up  i am inclined to disagree  i find the pick up and cruising ability to be more than adequate  on the highway  i have problems keeping it below 80 mph gas mileage could be better  i only get around 24 mpg around town  which is considerably less than my old toyota corolla and a couple of notches below my mazda protege build quality is very good  there are relatively few rattles  everything looks  quot snapped quot  together fairly well on the inside and out the only gripe i have with it is the new breed of volkswagen driver  i can tt stand seeing all these trendy little  quot friends quot  clones driving around in their jettas  i remember when the jetta used to be the vehicle of artists and college professors  ie people with brains  now i see a lot of dumb blondes and the whole starbucks crowd tooling around in their  quot cute quot  little jettas  it makes me ill br br  
Camera, I bought this camera so that I could put pictures on the internet for auctions  etc  I also liked the idea of being able to do inexpensive projects with the kids posters  pictures for family members etc We only paid  99 00 plus shipping through AOL and it did come pretty quick  no complaints there The camera serves it s purpose  for the time being  but if I could go back I would probably wait until I could afford a better one  It s ok for a first camera and it is good for enough for most of what I use it for but it s hard to get good close ups from it and it doesn t hold much in the memory  although you can purchase additional cards It s been a really neat toy for us though I love being able to share pictures online with family and friends just the technology of it all is exciting to us still It s also good for making sales flyers if you have something to sell in your community  a sofa for instance  Just put the photo on regular copy paper and add your info After all is said and done  I would say to look carefully and investigate your options before putting your money into it  If you are looking for a first digital camera for sharing photos with family and such it s not a bad camera for the basics I do like the idea of being able to get the pictures right away and not have to pay for the developing too  so it really was worth it to us in the long run  but still I wish I d waited  but hey  life is still good br br  
Camera, I have owned my Canon Power Shot A5 Digital Camera for about a year now  The Canon name has not disappointed me  Not only is it reasonably priced  but it is nearly fool proof to use  The auto focus and auto flash features assures that your pictures turn out properly  It is virtually What You See Is What You Get I have yet to have use the spare battery that comes with the camera It is very simple to use  but for the best results be sure to invest in really good photo software  If your intention is to print your photos on a printer  you will need a top of the line color printer with high resolution for the best results  I have also found it worthwhile to invest in the special photographic paper for final prints You can also download your photographs to disk and have them developed br br  
Camera, I have been wanting a digital camera ever since they first came out but  I just can t afford one just yet  So  when my daughter graduated this year I borrowed a friends Sony mavica 88  Now I know for sure what camera I am saving up for  This was extremely easy to operate  It has a big enough screen for viewing that it makes it easy to capture just the shot you want  The 16 times zoom is awesome  We were sitting way in the back of the auditorium and the pictures looked like we were right up front  It also takes beautiful indoors pictures  With a built in flash  The only problems I had was holding my hands steady enough that the items I was trying to photo didn t come out blurred  It takes a little practice to get used to how to push the button without moving the camera  It takes standard high density floppy disks which is real convenient as you don t have to plug the camera into your computer or have special software just for the camera  It depends on how you set up the camera as to how many pictures you can get on a disk  I kept it on the standard setting and got 7 pictures on a disk  This is another draw back to this type of camera  If you are going to be taking a lot of pictures you will need a lot of disks  When I did the pictures on the computer I was very pleased with how they turned out  I purchased the HP Photo ink cartridge and some photo paper and you would never know that they weren t professionally done  This camera also comes with two batteries and a recharger  Each battery lasts about 1 1 2 hours  All in all this is a great camera  I can t wait until I get one of my own br br

Camera, This was the first digital camera I bought  1997    and it was cheap for a digicam then  a snip at GBP499  USD750ish  Although I knew it wasn t a replacement for a 35mm  1 hour processing shop and a scanner  I had hoped to use it to take photos for the web  or for just playing around with  The lack of zoom or flash  however  restrict it to brightly lit indoor shots  or good light outdoor shots  And since you can t zoom the lens  you re restricted in what you can snap anyway  The swivel head is an interesting novelty  allowing you to examine your nostrils using the LCD viewfinder  which only updates about 3 4 times a second  which rules out action shots  Finally  the software is actually reasonably good  for its age  but you are restricted to serial comms  no flash cards  USB  etc In all   only buy one if you re absolutely desperate for a digital camera  and you find one going for less than  25 50  35 75 br br  
Camera, My Visioneer MX230 has almost all the same features of significantly more expensive cameras  I am extremely happy with the zoom  picture quality  display viewing features  adaptability  and ease of use PROS Video clips up to 60 seconds in length with sound Can  playback  video clips with sound on camera  mini speaker Can connect camera to TV through standard RCA plug to view pics from the camera directly to TV Great quality pics Good enough ZOOM  3x optical   3x digital Small   light size Easy to use  features Various settings for lighting conditions   ZOOM Comes with cable to connect directly to any PC with USB ports Software packaged with camera with accomplish almost any image editing needs you have CONS Longest video clip length is 60 seconds  better than many others  but should be unlimited   to extent of memory filling up  You can keep taking consecutive 60 second clips and paste them together later with digital editing software on your computer  but you loose out on the ability to have a continual long clip Red eye  is common on normal flash mode  Does have a flash setting to reduce red eye  This also can be fixed with image editing software on PC As all digital cameras  very limited  internal  memory  8MB  Plan for 8 higher quality pics or about 24 medium quality pics with internal memory  Better yet  plan to buy an SD Memory Card  which expands the memory picture storage  Count on one picture per MB of memory for high quality pictures  I bought a 256MB and that has been fine  Prices are coming down on the memory cards  I bought mine on eBay for about  60  but I ve recently been seeing them retail  with rebate  for same at various computer stores  You will also need a memory card  reader  to allow your PC to  read  the files off the card  I actually got several card  readers   Dazzle  for free during one of OfficeMax s recent sales No manual focus  for those pesky times when the autofocus can t get the focal distance right  I ve had some trouble focusing in  Macro  mode Battery drain SUCKS  literally  Alkalines drain after about 8 pictures  The 500 mAh NiCads I initially bought lasted about 25 to 40 pics  There is solution  though  Plan on spending some money on TOP QUALITY AA batteries  I got the best of the best of the best  I found some NexCell NiMH 2100 mAh on eBay  These go for  2 to  4 retail EACH  I paid about  1 50 each battery  I got 12  but now realize that 4 is probably enough  but 6 to 8 batteries would be plenty  Now I can get 250 to 500 pictures per pair of AAs I install Small LCD display No picture editing within camera  This is actually no problem at all for me  I beleive in taking as many pictures as possible  No deleting by me  let alone any on camera editing of images  I dump all the pics off the memory card onto my PC and delete or edit  if necessary   mostly just cropping  adjust brightness  and eliminating red eye  from there  Why waste battery life   view your editing on small LCD Overall  I m extremely satisfied  I was able to purchase my camera for  99 at OfficeMax  I bought a 256MB SD memory card on eBay for  60  a NiCad NiMH battery charger at CompUSA for  15  came with 4AA   4AAA NiCad batteries which I use in other items since I bought better batteries  and 12 NiMH batteries on eBay for under  20  
Camera, 1  Why did I buy it This is my first digital camera  I bought it because I need it for my summer vacation  and I need one with great image quality so the pictures can last a life time 2  How do I know about the DSC P72 At first I did some research online try to find the perfect camera for me because I know nothing about digital camera  Looking in to the price  performance  quality  and brand I finally found the one for me  Sony CyberShot DSC P72 3  Sony CyberShot DSC P71 DSC P72 A lot of people wonder what s the different between the DSC P71 and DSC P72  Basically  the P72 is a newer model of the P71  The P72 fixed some of the problems in the P71 and overall improved the performance  So  if you re thinking of buying the DSC P71  you might want to check out the P72 4  The image quality The Sony DSC P72 has a resolution of 3 2 Mega pixels  which is more than enough for casual use  The P72 has 5 modes to choose from when taking pictures  the bigger the number mean the bigger the picture and higher quality  You can switch the mode anytime 3 1M XL 2 8M L 2 0M M 1 2M S VGA 640x480 I use VGA and 2 0M most of the time  because I like to post my pictures on the internet  3 1M is the best quality and the biggest size of them all  but the size of the file is too big  so it s not a good choice to use 3 1M if you want to upload the images to the net  Just take pictures in all the modes and find the perfect one for your needs 5  The movie mode The DSC P72 allows you to record short video with sound  The length of the movie depends on the size of your memory stick  The memory stick included with this camera is 16MB which can record movie up the 20 seconds with sound  I like this movie mode a lot  its fun to capture video sometime  And the video and sound quality is very good  6  The LCD screen The size of the LCD screen is 1 5 inch same as most of the digital camera in the market right now  The screen is very clear  You can even change the brightness and contrast After you took pictures or recorded a video you can go to the playback mode and view your pictures video  You can put them in different folders  delete them and do whatever you want with them 7  Ease of use You can operate this camera with one finger  everything can be set to automatic  and the camera will do the rest of the work for you  If you want more control  just press one button and set it to the way you like it  I use automatic on my entire picture collection  the quality  lighting and everything else is great 8  Upload images to your PC WOW Super fast and easy  all you have to do is plug in the USB cable to your PC and The camera  and everything will be done automatically 9  Bottom line The only problem I found is the battery life  but since Sony gave us a rechargeable battery and a charger  that s not a big problem If you re looking for a digital camera with great image quality and easy to use  The DSC P72 is the one for you  You can not go wrong with this camera  it s just that good The package included 1 DSC P72 camera 2 rechargeable batteries 1 charger 1 16MB memory stick 1 CD Thanks for reading my review  I hope this is helpful to some of you  
Camera, I purchased this camera shortly after they came out  I had read reviews in the various magazines and was intrigued by the concept  I had a coupon at a web store and got it at a minimal price The camera is very small and easily fits into a shirt pocket  It uses one AAA battery and the battery life seems to be very good  It has a view finder  but no LCD to view the photos taken  probably due to the small size of the camera  That is not a problem   you sacrifice this for the small size  The package included a mounting device so you can use the camera as a webcam   I have not tried this The photos can be transferred to your PC using a special USB cable that is included in the package  This is a very easy process  I use a photo editor to  acquire  the images from the camera to the PC Big disappointment in picture quality  The specs say it takes photos at 640X480 resolution  but the quality is very  very poor  The center of each photo is OK  but the outer one quarter on the top  bottom  and sides is out of focus  At first  I thought it was because I wasn t holding the camera still  but the out of focus areas still appeared even when bracing the camera against something solid  There is no flash  nor any means to add one  so indoor photos must use available lighting Its too bad that the photo quality is so terrible  because this would be a nifty camera to own  It is probably the smallest camera on the market at about 2  X 2  You could have it with you wherever you go All in all  I cannot recommend this camera  
Auto, Before I get into the car details  you may question why I write this review  Being a 16 year old avid car fan who drives his mother s car for transportation to work school etc  I may not know EVERYTHING about this car  but for the 300 some odd miles I ve driven this car there has been alot of valuable things that I have learned  and right here is where i would like to share them with you I was 13 when my mom went to a Toyota dealer and bought this off the lot  Little did she know that 3 years later her  little boy  would be driving around in the same car by himself  yes I know its hard for me to even believe just yet  I m not exactly sure how much she spent for it  I would guess maybe around 12 14 000  If it is important to this review i will ask her myself So where shall we start  Interior Exterior Interior Exterior OK OK lets go with the Interior Interior Not too much to say  everything basic  pwr everything  overdrive  A C  rear defrost  There is also a Digital Odometer and Daytime Running Lights  something i haven t seen in other cars so this is maybe what separates it from those other cars  This car provides a good amount of room  unless you are a professional wrestler or Shaq  you probably will not be fitting into this car  Room in the back is good  Room in the front however in the drivers side is a little different  I m pushing 6 1 and I have the seat all the way back  and the steering wheel moved all the way up  All these efforts still do not eliminate the problem of my left knee hitting the steering wheel  Trunk space is quite good  I recall fitting 3 golf bags into the back  so if thats how you rate your trunk space then you re set  The system will not attract any attention really  Yeah if you turn it up 80  you ll get some bumping out of it  but I m not very impressed  Putting some subs in the back will easily eliminate this problem The Exterior I m going to keep this short and simple  since it s late and I want to go to bed  This car will in NO WAY turn heads  It is a simple 4 door design  nothing really seems to be too special about it  Anything else you want to know about the exterior  Too bad because there isn t anything else to know  If you spend maybe 2 thousand for some ground effects  put a spoiler on there  then we can talk Under The Hood Not much can be said about it  It s an l 4 basic for this type of car  It has a 1 8L engine  like I said  basic for this kind of car  This can make the car pretty weak  I drive up the same uphill road every day  and every day im having to push the car just so i can maintain a steady 65 70MPH highway speed  I find the acceleration to be all right  me being a person who loves to pour out of a turn coming off a red light  I can find that I can get up to 40 pretty quickly  and i find myself saying  Hey  that Ferrari 360 Spyder was just behind me so where did it go  Thats when my dreams get shattered and he s actually 3 miles ahead of me already  But hey  the pickup trucks and those Honda s eat dust  The Corolla redlines at 6000  so you can eliminate the drag racing up at race wars in the desert  The 4 cylinder smaller engine will make things better for you  If you hate gas guzzlers  then you know right now you ll be a bigger fan of this car  Taking the thing to the Mobil station for the first time  putting only 10 bucks in the tank and filling it up completely felt good  And if you liked that  you ll like the 30  MPG that this car gets The Ride It provides a really smooth ride  I haven t really found anything wrong with the ride yet  but if I do  you know that I ll keep you informed     The brakes seem a little bit weak compared to my dad s Mitsubishi Galant or my stepdad s BMW 5 series  It s no huge problem to worry about  but when I go from driving the Galant to driving the Corolla  I can tell there is somewhat of a difference  Nothing wrong with the handling  Front engine Front wheel drive  with new snow tires  I find minimal problems with the handling in the winter  Minimal problems means the few times you ll slide on the ice when taking a turn  I had the misfortune of taking my road test in the biggest snowstorm all year  but I had no problems with anything  Handling in regular weather is the same as it is for any car that I have driven  Nothing horrible  but nothing great enough that I can tell how great it is This car will not turn heads  Unless you have a half naked woman in the car or you have a 16 year old just getting his license who wants to drive and have his freedom  I do not think you will see a guy stepping into this car  If you want a car you can drive down the street and people look at you with the thought in their head of  Wow that guy is lucky  then buy a new red Trans Am  preferably with Ram Air and a black racing stripe with tinted windows and 2  12 subs in the trunk  my dream car  But if you are looking for a car just to get from Point A to Point B  then you might want to definitely take the Corolla into consideration  And the reliability speaks for itself  YOU put in the work the YOU will have a long lasting car  And yes we all know about Toyota s reputation for that very long lasting car  If these are the few things you want in a car  then now you know what to buy P S  I had the TV going while I was typing this up  call it a coincidence  but right when I finished this review  a commercial for the new 2002 Corolla just came on  
Camera, I just purchased My Dimage 5 a couple days ago  and I have to say I m Impressed  First off  the salesmen at best buy  and Wolf camera both shook their heads and said that it ate batteries so fast that they absolutely couldn t recommend it  Well  I m happy to say that alkalines are shot in under 10 minutes  but Rechargable nickel Metal Hydride batteries lasted me for over 1 1 2 hours of constant usage before dying  I popped off over 100 photos  30 of which I used a flash for  Not bad considering  I bought three sets of batteries and a charger at best buy for  60 00  that should buy me about 4 hours of constant usage  I m not trying to focus just on the batteries  but I know that was my main concern  and I haven t read much real world feedback on that subject yet  My conclusion  Battery situation is not as bad as it sounds Next  It took me a good 2 hours to finally take a good picture  I know nothing about SLR cameras  so I had to take a crash course off the web in aperature setting  exposure value  and ISO setting etc  The auto mode takes decent pictures  but the auto focus is a tad slow  if you use the flex focus feature though  focusing is a breeze  There are alot of tweakable features for the real camera buff  I m not going to pretend to be an expert  but I took a picture in near darkness  and it looked great  I took several others  and they all ended up looking pretty stellar  I m amazed at the quality of the macro shots  They are absolutely beautiful  The 7X optical zoom is phenomenal  That was the clincher for me  I love having all of that play  a 2x zoom just doesn t cut it for me  It s a solid camera  it doesn t get as hot as everyone reports  in fact  I find it hard to tell if it s warm from the batteries  or because it s warming up from my hand  The picture quality is far superior to my cybershot 3 2 megapixel by sony  I printed out a photo of about 20x16 at full res on the map printer at work  beautiful  photos printed on my HP deskjet on Kodak photo paper were mouth watering  I ve been using a Canon powershot  and a sony cybershot for the last year  This camera is in a whole different class  If you ve got the time to learn a little about basic photography  you too can be taking artsy fartsy shots like me in only a few days I highly recommend this camera  This is from not a photography expert  but from an average joe who s starting at square one  Any specific questions  e mail me   steve steve lynch com 
Auto, This Ferrari replaces the last series of the 330GT 2 2s  It has a V 12 engine which will give you a good amount of power  Although this car has a weight of 3500 lbs  it can still go over the speed of 150  This car has been criticized for being so large and yet such small space in the back  However  when you buy a car like a Ferrari  you shouldn t expect that of any other car  This car isn t very rare for a Ferrari coming it at a total production of 800  and one of the most numerous productions for a type of a Ferrari  Also  they are one of the most easy to acquire today  
Auto, This little SUV truck is fun to drive  great for stashing snowy ski or snow gear quickly  hospitable to two dogs  easy to clean  except for console  and a delight to look at  once you get used to it  It handles well in the snow  even on back roads to the trail head  going up hill and breaking trail  You can put a mountain bike in it upright  just walk it right in I think Honda meant the Element for 20 year old lads  I am a 55 year old female  Ha ha  Honda  Here in the mountain country of south central Montana  the car is selling to people between 35 and 80  and most of them female  There are 6 of them in a town of 6800 people  It is great for car camping  although a little short on stowage room  If you plan it right and put your gear in bags or containers that will fit under the back seatback when it is folded down for sleeping  then you can just move the containers under your  bed  when it is sleeping time  Or get rooftop storage  which I chose not to do since it ruins the fun lines of this boxy vehicle with the neat curved roof  It s so easy to fold down the seats  take out the sleeping bag  sleep relatively comfortably  and then just scoot up into the driver s seat  upright the seatback  and drive away for an early start  Then when it is light out again  pull over and re fit the cargo area and stash your gear for the day Minor flaws  rear bumper could be larger  less sloped  Can t even set down a cup of coffee on it  Console between driver and passenger is low enough to make it easy to reach into back  good  but impossible to clean  bad  If it had a liner that popped out for cleaning or a lid  that would be perfect  Overall  storage compartments could be a little better thought out  Otherwise a perfect vehicle  
Camera, Hi everyone  The HP 315 camera is a nice camera for the price  My husband is 6 4 and has large hands and this fit well in his hand where as I am 5 1 and little hands so this was a little on the bulky side for me  I followed the directions and took some pictures of our daughter etc  However when it came time to download the pictures I had a problem  I immediately called HP and they told me that they were having problems with the Windows ME USB and could not get my pictures to download  HP told me to call my pc manufacturer  I have an emachine and they have a terrible warranty only a 15 day warranty after your first problem then you have to pay 25 dollars a problem  I called Emachines and they recommended that I return this product as it does not work well with Windows ME  I bought this camera because of the USB capability  The only way I would be able to use this camera is if I purchased a card reader  I didn t want to have to use this as I wanted to be able to directly hook this up to the USB  If you have Windows ME I do not recommend this camera  However  for those of you with Windows 98 etc this is a nice camera and the images on the LCD appear very clear  I found the menu screen etc easy to use  I didn t realize after I purchased this that it does not allow you to choose the speed or the black and white or sepia tones  I wanted a camera that did that  For the price the camera is a good deal and offers a higher pixel than other cameras at this price  I bought this one for  250 00  If you are a beginner and do not want a lot of frills just the high pixel than this is a good camera  I did find that the camera drained the batteries fairly quickly so I definitely recommend the ac adapter which you can purchase fairly cheap on ebay brand new  All in all if this camera had worked with my PC I would have kept the HP 315 and been HAPPY with it  As of now I still have not bought another watching the opinions of others  I hope this helped you  
Camera, This is a pretty good camera for the money which boasts a number of usable features  2 1 pix and interchangable memory cards make for an easy way to get lots of snapshots at a reasonable quality p I use this for taking everyday pictures of my daughter and other family stuff  It s not a serious photographers camera  but few digitals are at that point yet  You NEED to purchase the larger memory cards  Mine came with a 4 MB one and I immediately bought a 16MB  which somedays is even to little at 1200x1600 p The controls are good  easily understood and placed well  The camera itself fits naturally in the hand  though is a little large to carry around everyday everywhere  A friend of mine has a Canon S10  i think  which is way smaller and a no brainer to flip in your pocket p Though I haven t run into a problem with the battery life  I can see it being a problem  I always charge the thing the night before I know I will use it to be safe and usually the day night will end before the battery does  though conservative use of flash is needed p Also not sure about the durability  though it looks like a metal casing  it s really plastic  and feels like it ll break with even the slightest mistouch p The one thing that really bugs me about this is taking snaps with the flash  there is a way noticable delay between initial flash and actual picture  compounded when the red eye reduction is on  double flash essentially  So the subjects move  thinking the picture is taken  and the pictures end up blurred  Perhaps it s inexperience at digital photography  and I will play with settings and whatnot to see if that helps  but it s annoying p Overall  it s a good unit  and has paid for itself in the memories captured where they wouldn t have been with a regular camera  too much bother to load film  reload film  take for processing  etc

Camera, The C 2000 Olympus digital camera is the answer to those of us who are purists   we love the SLR  programmable or manual mode  but want the ease of download without giving up the resolution  I own 3 SLR bodies and numerous lenses  but this is the camera that I will take along for the ride  i e  not serious shoots necessarily  but it s so easy to take with you   it s hard to leave behind This camera is easy to use  easy to hold  much easier than others which are smaller with smaller buttons   read Nikon  and yet has many of the capabilities of a regular SLR camera  One of the pluses of this camera is its optical viewer   and the fact that the LCD is protected  unlike many other digital cameras  where your LCD very quickly gets smudges and even lines  The biggest negative with this camera  unlike the Nikons  is that it  eats  battery power  You must purchase as accessories the ac adapter  an additional smart card  minimum 16 mg  I would also recommend you purchase the floppy card adapter  which will allow you to download pictures much faster with less power drain to the camera This camera has wide angle  zoom and macro modes for its lens  It has the ability to  quot push quot  the film  or should I say   push the digital frame  and has other neat options like red eye reduction  TTL flash  built in  date time option  I could go on and on To protect the camera   you should also invest in a camera case   you can get a relatively inexpensive one to protect your investment  Spend the extra money   it will be well worth the investment  Enjoy br br  
Auto, I purchased a 99 Suzuki Swift with the following expectations Exellent gas mileage Low price Easy handling Reliability I have not been disappointed  I drive up to 100 miles daily in my job as a home health nurse  I am faced with all types of weather including ice and snow  This car handles very well in both  The only weather that it doesn t measure up to is in high winds  My little Swift reminds me of the old Volkswagon Bugs that I used to own years ago when it comes to being blown around  I was able to purchase my Swift for 1000 00 less than dealer s invoice and also qualified for a no down 5 9  loan through Suzuki Auto Credit I did not expect A quiet ride Lots of leg room Lots of power I would certainly recommend this car to anyone who needs a reliable  affordable vehicle  I would also recommend this car to anyone who is considering a Hyundai or Geo Metro  Swifts are almost identical to Metros except for having a more powerful engine     
Camera, I bought the Epson 3000z after comparing its  features to other 3 3 megapixel cameras  Compared to the Olympus 3030  I preferred the 3000z s use of compact flash  Compared to the Sony DSC S70  I preferred the 3000z s use of compact flash  smartmedia I might consider  but I can t think of a good excuse for memory sticks  and ergonomics  I wanted a 3x zoom  so the Canon S 20 was out  The Nikon Coolpix 990 also closely fit my specs  but I found with an earlier Nikon 900 that battery life was a big issue and that the twist body doesn t suit me  so I thought I d try another brand My experience so far with the 3000z has been mixed  The camera can take very good pictures  The lens is fast and sharp  A tiff mode is available  Battery life is very good  On the other hand  the shutter button does not give good tactile feedback  which makes pre focusing an adventure  I haven t quite gotten to the bottom of the problem  but in some modes focusing is error prone  leading to a number of blurry  throw away pictures  Also  the highest quality setting for jpegs results in files of only about 1 meg or less  Apparent quality is fine  but I would prefer to be able to save a larger  less lossy jpeg  Tiffs are available  but a real problem because they tie up the camera for about 20 seconds while saving At the time I bought the camera  I also purchased a Canon EOS 3  one of Canon s best prosumer 35mm bodies  which I find to be an interesting contrast  The price is not that far apart  I took both on a trip recently  The EOS 3 has many more options available to set parameters around a photograph  and much more sophisticated metering and focusing systems  It has a teriffic viewfinder  When you press the shutter it really conveys the sense that you have just taken a good picture  In contrast  the 3000z is smaller and more convenient  but it seems like a toy by comparison   or more accurately like a cheap point and shoot camera On my return I had the film developed  and it was pretty clear that I was more successful taking the pictures I wanted to take with the EOS 3  But the development and print process introduces variables  and my preferred output device normally is a computer screen  so after development I use a film scanner to scan the best pictures  This takes time and introduces more variables  What the 3000z has going for it is immediate accessibility in digital form and generally accurate color balance which requires little correction My overall verdict on the 3000z is that it is a frustrating product  and frustratingly close to being good  Simple usability problems prevent the camera from being satisfactory  but it can produce good results with a little luck  I m still a strong believer in digital photography  We re just not there yet with the 3000z     
Camera, About a year ago  I purchased a 775 from Dell  900 pictures later  I m happy with the money I spent on this camera  310 after price matching The biggest advantage to this camera is its size  Sure  there are many cameras out there that will provide superior picture quality and have setting adjustments that will appease the most advanced of photographers  but with most of those cameras  you have to think twice before you bring it with you  I ve captured many great moments with this camera because I didn t have to think twice  It fits in your pocket with ease and you ll soon forget that it s even there  It s made out of plastic  so it looks almost like a toy  but it s well made and very sturdy  I dropped it once and it still works fine  The picture quality is good  not great  Colors are represented well  but not as vibrant as some of the other digital cameras that I ve seen  The pictures do come out a little soft  but this can be corrected by using the sharpening function in Photoshop  I ve printed many 4x6 pictures from the camera  and most of the pictures look quite nice  haven t tried 8x10 yet  The downside of this camera is it s slow startup time  It takes a good 10 seconds for the camera to be ready to go  Picture to picture downtime is less  but probably still slow overall  I think the slowness might be due to the memory card I m using because I remember the camera being faster when I still had the 8 MB card that it came with  Once you get used to it  the slowness of the camera is not a major concern  You just have to think ahead a little before you take a picture If all your picture taking consists of point and shoot pictures  then the 775 is a great option  Even if you are a professional photographer  I think you will still find some use for it because of it s portability  You ll take pictures that you never would have taken before because you ll have this camera there for those unexpected moments  
Camera, My mother in law has one of these cameras and I would say that out of all I have seen that this is a camera that is very easy to use It takes no time for you to snap your pictures  and load them onto your computer or Floppy disk It actually takes really good pictures  she doesn t use a regular camera anymore now that she can get her pictures and see how they turned out just minutes after she takes them The Polaroid Photomax camera is at the top of my list because it is so easy to use and it comes with a great program that enables you to make several things and even print your pictures on a sheet of paper in multiple numbers I  myself  rather like that option because it saves you time on trying to get the exact size and having to go back each time to print more that one of the same size  You can do it all at once It is my opinion that if you ever use the camera that you will love it and the program that comes with it br br  
Camera, I think the basic feature list has been covered more than sufficiently in other reviews  so I d like to concentrate more on what I have done and discovered with my 880 b Picture quality  I have been waiting until 3  megapixel cameras became reasonably priced  With that level of detail  you can make great looking 8x10 s  or have enough detail to crop and zoom  when necessary The 880 produces great looking pictures  with lots of detail and color  Other reviews commented on how sharp the pictures looked  It took me a while to realize that  sharpness  was turned on by default  While this may actually make for a very sharp snapshot  in some cases  too much sharpness will cause  ringing   or fringing  around objects  which may affect enlargements more than snapshots  I have one shot in particular that would have been much better without this artifact  Since I can always sharpen in my photo software  I prefer this option to be off  and then I will sharpen when I want  When I have photos printed  uploaded to a web site  and they send back the prints  they look fantastic  I think pictures look better than those taken with my automatic 35mm  Digital photography is finally here b Taking pictures  I really don t make much use of the  scene  modes  although  I do think that they might come in handy when you don t have the time to mess with the manual feature and or don t remember what settings to use  Typically  putting it into  auto  will take good shots most of the time  I can hand the camera to someone else  and there s no mystery  This is particularly an important feature if you want more manual control  but your spouse does not   Here s a feature that is better than a typical 35mm automatic camera  it will focus through glass  at a subject  rather than focusing on the glass   With an autofocus camera  you often have to go into landscape infinity mode and hope for the best  or manually adjust the focus distance  if that feature is available  On the 880  it is also possible to manually set the distance  but not while in the automatic mode The manual modes were a selling point for me  There are some other cameras that have a wider range of manual adjustments  Canon G1  I think  so the 880 is a bit of a compromise  However  if you re like me and trying to move beyond the beginner stage and take more interesting pictures  it provides a lot more options beyond the usual automatic camera settings  If you re an experienced photographer who is used to an SLR  there may not be enough adjustments for you If you have stitching software  the 880 has an  AE Lock  mode which will allow you to take several pictures with the same exposure settings  This allows you to create panoramas and have the same exposure across the entire panorama   Without such a setting  each picture would get a different brightness or even color  and it could be an unpleasant effect when you stitch them together  Don t forget to  reset  or turn  off  the AE Lock mode when done  I have done a couple of neat 360 pictures  viewable on the computer  but it s hard to find a situation where there s something nice to look at in all directions   I have tried using the BSS  Best Shot Selector  but it seems too inconsistent to me  It s supposed to take multiple shots and choose the ones with the least amount of blur  but perhaps the real problem is that it s too easy to take a blurry shot That brings me to one of the negative points  and perhaps this affects other digital cameras  however  most of my experience is with this camera  so I can t compare    it s very easy to blur pictures  particularly in low light situations  It does a fantastic job of giving you a picture in low light conditions  but it needs to hold the shutter open longer to do so  As long as the camera is very stable  and the subject doesn t move much  you can get a great shot with very natural looking lighting  I really like to attempt these shots  however  many photos turn up blurry  With a flash  you get a stable picture even in lower light conditions  but then the battery is drained even faster  I also do not always like the harshness of flash   sometimes it looks good  sometimes not   Not to mention that the flash is only suitable if the subject is within several feet  If you can stabilize the camera  say  by resting it on something or leaning against something  you can get more stable shots even without a tripod  That technique has been helpful  particularly when I am fortunate enough to be able to line up the shot and use the timer so that my hand does not even touch it when it snaps the picture I think it is worth noting that often times the  blur  that people notice is mostly when zooming in on the detail of the picture  If printed as a 4x6 snapshot  you often will not see a problem  or not enough to bother the eye  At 3  megapixels  that s far more resolution than is needed for a 4x6  so you have to consider that it looks worse when zoomed  In other words  if you had the same amount of camera shake using a lower resolution 2 megapixel camera  when you zoomed into the latter  it would appear  less blurred  but you re really looking at less detail as well Having said all of that  I spend a lot of time trying to compensate to avoid blurring shaking It s worth noting that the camera defaults to  normal  picture quality mode  I always use  fine  mode  which doubles the size of the picture  but reduces the jpeg artifacts to a very low level  If you can afford the memory  you might as well get the clearest pictures possible If you run low on memory  and you know you don t need anything more than 4x6  prints  you can lower the resolution and take quite a few more pictures  I only do that when I m desperate and fill up my memory  which I do pretty often  actually  I d rather have more detail than I need  rather than the other way around b Accessories  Boy  are they expensive  You pretty much need to buy the power adapter and battery  though  Not to mention a larger CF card I might like to get additional filters or lenses  but they are a bit pricey  Also  the remote shutter trigger is very expensive For a case  I purchased a small Lowepro which is built tough with lots of padding  The 880 fits this particular model like a glove  They have an entire series for digital cameras that has slots for holding memory cards  batteries  and other handy features b Software  The main thing I thought was interesting about the included software was the  limited edition  fractal file format plugin  Using this  only works as a plugin to certain paint programs  you can load pictures and enlarge them to much higher resolutions  and it fills in detail better than typical paint software  This works best if you at least have good detail in the original picture  without blurring shaking  However  I haven t found this to be as useful as I expected  as 3 megapixels seems to do a fine job of 8x10s b Summary  I m very happy with the output of the camera  and I enjoy experimenting with the extra features  My wife enjoys the automatic mode  and claims to be happy with the results  
Camera, Been using the Canon Digital Elph S110 Powershot after having used the Sony Mavica family of cameras as well as the Kodak DC 280 and 3400  I have to Say that the Canon S100 is by far the best  For all the same features  you get with the other cameras  you get so much more with The Canon  It s got a small form factor that really makes it so convenient to carry around  That s the huge advantage with this camera  Who wants to lug around their beastly Sony Mavica around after using this   and who wants to use floppy disks anyways After using the S100 for awhile  I traded up to the S110  It s got the same fantastic size as the S100 and improved optics  the addition of the movie mode for small AVI movies is great  Otherwise there s little difference between the S100 and S110  and I heartily recommend both  The included software package for BOTH Mac and PC is great  with easy setup and lots of great features  Just another reason to go with Canon Digital Cameras It s easy to set up  and the picture quality is fantastic  You can t beat that  My only gripes  Canon doesn t include a spare battery  the stock Compact Flash card is ONLY 8 MB  and there is no case included  Kinda cheap for a camera that is really nice The PowerShot S110 features an elegant  stainless steel  SUS316  body equipped with a number of advanced camera features including a 35 70mm  35mm equivalent  f 2 8 4 0 all glass aspherical lens to help minimize image distortion  A 4x digital converter extends the zoom range of the lens to 8x when used in conjunction with its 2x optical zoom capabilities  In addition  the camera is equipped with a three point AiAF autofocus system that permits the camera to automatically select the primary subject  even if the subject is off center  To further simplify overall operation  the Digital ELPH displays most camera settings on the LCD monitor  While using the control buttons at the base of the monitor  users can confirm desired camera functions identified on the LCD monitor with easy to understand icons or minimal text  The Digital ELPH features a 0 37 inch  2 1 megapixel CCD sensor that creates full color or black and white images up to 1600x1200 pixels when set to the camera s Large resolution mode  The camera also offers an additional resolution setting of 640 x 480 when set in the Small mode  which is ideal for on screen applications  such as Web sites and CD ROMs and allows more images to be recorded on a single CompactFlash memory card  The new camera is compatible with Type I CompactFlash Cards and will be shipped with an 8MB CF card  In order to maximize the capabilities of the 2 1 megapixel CCD  the PowerShot S100 is equipped with a dedicated digital signal processing integrated circuit  IC  to achieve high speed and complete processing of image detail  All images are recorded as JPEG files and a built in buffer memory allows continuous burst mode shooting of up to 2 frames per second when set to its maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200  The interval between shots in single frame mode is only 1 7 seconds  In addition  basic operations such as camera start up  high speed search mode during playback  image enlargement and image scrolling can now be executed swiftly  due to the digital signal processing IC s high speed compression and decompression operations  The photo quality I get from printing pics from ofoto com is fantastic  Sharp and easy on the eyes  Costco recently started printing pictures too  Their quality is similiar to Ofoto com  and lest costly  Color saturation is not quite as rich though  with a few pics looking more greenish I got mine from Outpost com because they had free shipping and NO tax  Yay  Also  if you shop through Ebates  you get another 5  back   you can use them FREE to shop at many other stores for up to 25  back  http www ebates com index jsp referrer kenfused yahoo com 
Auto, First off I was 18 years old when I bought this car  And I picked this car over a BMW because I wanted something different to  FIX  up  since everybody   their mother in my neighbor hood drives a BMW I bought the car May  01   started having car problems around September  01 when it started getting cold  I researched   at www edmunds com I found out I had a TSB  Technical Service Bulletin  out for bad start  which I too to the Nissan Dealer   they fixed right away  But I picked up car it had scratches on the trunk   they said they were there  I told them it wasn t   blamed whoever washed my car there did it  Bottom line they didn t fix the problem   that was the last time I went to that service dept I then heard wind noise   found out there was another TSB out on that   http www edmunds com ownership maintenance articles 44745 article html     called another Nissan Dealership   got the wind noise fixed Also I ve had excessive paint chips    I don t do any highway driving  Which comes to conclusion that the Nissan Paint sucks so if you buy a new car  make sure you have the 3M Clearbra installed  http www xpel com or check with your nearest Ziebart Now down to flaws  the suspension sucks because it has too much body roll so I installed a Front Strut Tower Brace  FSTB    a Rear Sway Bar made by Stillen com  which cut the body roll by alot  I also had H R Springs installed to lower car 1 5 inches which it makes car look nicer   gives it better respond on turns P S    If you want to feel like its a Sports Sedan then buy Manual   not Automatice  because that s one mistake I did Also I ve done alot to my car in reference to adding stuff  like a Ground Effect Kit  Exhaust  Tints  Rims   got most of my buys   ideas from forums maxima org   www custommaxima com   www cardomain com   www 5thgenmaximas com 
Auto, This car is amazing  I normally drive a Saturn  but the Lexus ES300 was a dream come true  It delivered things I didn t even know I wanted  When you turn on the car  it is quiet  The engine is virtually silent misleading especially considering the power under this car s hood  This Lexus is so quiet  you don t even notice that you re accelerating  My model has certain amenities leather seats  heated seats  CD player  sunroof  I must say these all add to the pleasures of the car  Everything detail is considered  On the heated seats  for example  I can choose high or low heating  The A C controls work by a knob that s easy to turn  Every control in the car is digital  so volume  temperature  and other settings are precise  One drawback is that the console features are hard to change while driving  They are in the middle area but at or below steering wheel level  That is  I have to take my eyes from the road to change a CD  look for the temperature control  or press a certain preset radio station  This is an important safety factor to keep in mind when considering this car  On the positive side  the pre programmable garage door openers in the car are very exciting and useful  The car is built overall with a mind toward practicality  Long skis can fit in the trunk by going through to the box seat  There are seat positions able to be preset for two different drivers  And the center container has two levels  good for me because I like to prioritize  gum  cell phone  emergency tools  etc     
Camera, This camera is a great buy  Casio really out did themselves on this one  I was looking at this camera for awhile and the resolution is outstanding Zooming in on a distant object was never so much clearer  Also this camera is small and barely has any weight  It s multi option feature is a definite plus when wanted to get that perfect picture  Everyone looking to buy this should not give this item a second thought yet purchase it on that first thought  The lens on this camera is a great feature  Plus the number one feature of all  ITS DIGITAL  Easily connects to the computer with a driver and TA DA you have all your pictures inside your computer to do whatever you want with br br  
Camera, As a first digital camera  I feel that the Polaroid Photomax 640 with ImageMaker software is tops  At under  200 at Wal Mart  it has all the features that a novice could want  It features a wide range of resolution options  allowing from 12 to 96 images to be stored on the memory card  It has three range settings and 4 flash settings  I have used mine for about three months and have had wonderful results  My only complaint is the loss of sharpness in enlargements  The ImageMaker software has many options for making and printing pictures  such as printing multiple copies  and multiple sizes of a picture on a single sheet of paper  The software also allows you to email your pictures with music  great frames and backgrounds  I would recommend this package to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive first digital camera that does a lot of things that the more expensive cameras do     
Auto,  The folks at Hyundai must be in the middle of a grandiose manic episode  They just finished pulling off introducing the Hyundai Santa Fe into the mini SUV market  and now they plan on attacking the highly competitive mid sized sedan market head on  Will they accomplish it with this new entry  I wondered that myself b I had first seen the XG300 in a local auto show that came into town  I was impressed by the clean lines and upscale look  though I found the overall appearance a little sedated  Even so  upon further inspection  I could tell Hyundai was up to something  especially when I looked at the sticker price  As we all know  however  a low MSRP doesn t necessarily translate into success for a car  So I decided to take the XG300 for a spin   Again  for you San Antonians  the Red McComb s Pontiac Hyundai is a sleezy place  and I would recommend you look elsewhere  they do  however  have a huge volume of cars i b EXTERIOR  8  I ll admit it  I was humbled by this car at one point  when I first saw it on the road  I thought it was a Lincoln at first glance  From the front  the XG300 certainly does look stately  complete with its large grille and standard fog lamps  When I saw the car s profile  though  its true marque was given away  Yes  this was the new XG300  As I alluded to previously  the XG300 certainly makes an impression on those who see it  However  it may be a little dull for some  sporting the  Buick y  wheel covers  How  bout some spokes or something  Hyundai The XG300 is about the size of a Nissan Maxima  and larger than its little brother  the Sonata  One of my only troubling observations was its thin tires  Although they are V rated Michelins  their width seemed a little  wimpy  My fear upon seeing this was wallowy handling b INTERIOR  8  At first glance  I thought I was sitting in a much more expensive vehicle  Granted  one needs only a few seconds to realize that this is just a  budget luxury  car  Hyundai was generous with fake wood appointments  and the plastic  while not cheap feeling  certainly wasn t  Lexus par  either  All of this was to be expected of course  and all in all  I found the interior pleasing to the eye The dash  for instance  has a very clean appearance  with a flat button layout imitating a style you d find on higher end cars  The radio is placed high enough to be operated safely  Even though the climate controls are placed on the lowest part of the dash  they were easy to use without taking my eyes off the road The stereo didn t blow me away  but I feel it s on par with cars in this class  yes  that includes the Accord and company  The well positioned tweeters produced pure highs  while the 6 5  door mounted woofers thumped decent bass  Rear occupants may ask you to lower the volume  I could tell some larger speakers resided in the back  though I couldn t tell how big they were  6x9  is my best guess  The face is easy to read and use  with one notable exception  there is no volume knob  but rather the up and down button variety  I found this to be a real pain  because it took a lot of pushing to get the volume where I wanted it  Also included is a preset equalizer  where you can set the levels to  rock  live  classic  and flat  A six CD changer is optional  I d personally recommend it  or an after market one Climate controls worked smoothly and quietly  It was a hot day in San Antonio  but I didn t notice  The XG300 is roomy on all fronts  head room  leg room  and hip room were all impressive  This car can seat five comfortably  I use that last word loosely because as was the case during my drive of the Sonata  I could not seem to find a comfortable seating position  The seats are woefully lacking in lumbar  lateral  and butt  support  I would easily fatigue after driving an extended period of time b ENGINE  8  The 3 0L V6 churns out 192hp  Off the line and especially on the highway  I found the engine to accelerate comfortably  Official times for 0 to 60 are around nine seconds  which isn t bad  but not great  either  The automatic transmission shifts quickly and smoothly  though I found it a bit hesitant at times while passing  It would also downshift needlessly on occasion  The  H matic  is a standard manumatic feature  where you can slide the shifter away from you  it should be towards you  and flick the wrist up or down to shift  I just left it in automatic after playing with it for a while i Note  Hyundai has announced a 3 5L V6 will soon be coming into the line up  This should provide the XG300 with some impressive go power i b RIDE  7  While the XG300 rides smoothly  it rides perhaps a little too softly  big bumps will cause the whole body to undulate up and down  much like the old Buicks once did  Engine noise is impressively dampened  and little road or wind noise could be detected b HANDLING  6  My rating may seem a bit harsh  but I guess I was expecting better out of this car  There is an appreciable amount of body roll with even moderately sharp curves  and the little tires squeal if pushed just a little  I don t feel the XG300 is a dangerous handler  but it certainly won t be mistaken for a sports sedan  either  True  that s not what this car is being marketed as  but I still expected better Braking is pretty impressive  though when I hit the brakes hard  I could sense some fade  and the nose dove quite a bit b SAFETY   b Crash tests are pending  I ll update my review as soon as I see them b BUILD QUALITY  5  Unfortunately  I think Hyundai may have a few kinks to iron out here  I heard a rattle coming from the rear seat when I hit bumps  and some interior materials didn t look like they could stand up to abuse  The doors shudder and rattle when you slam them  The power controls didn t even work every time I pushed them  Not good  I found this surprising because even the build quality of the economy class  Elantra  inspired more confidence out of me when I drove it  Having read other professional reviews noting the same troubles  it seems I am not alone in this opinion  As Sean Connery would say   pity b VALUE  8  No question  the XG300 has got an impressive bang for your buck factor  as do many Hyundai cars  The fully loaded XG300  L  for under  25 grand  And this includes standard leather seats  power adjustable front seats  remote keyless entry with alarm  a six speaker stereo system with CD player  power moonroof  memory driver seat and outside mirrors  heated front seats  and an auto dimming rear mirror  I would have given this car a  9  as far as value is concerned  but alas  resale value is expected to be poor  Don t ask me how these things are determined  if you know  drop me a line  but either way  it doesn t bode well for when you want to sell the thing The questionable build quality may translate into a high cost of ownership  but at least there s an impressive warranty to balance some of that out b VERDICT  THERE S SOME PROMISE HERE  BUT I D WAIT b The XG300 is a clear and promising indicator of where Hyndai wants to go with its cars  However  it seems to me that the company may have  jumped the gun  with the XG300  Perhaps a little patience and more extensive testing on their part would have produced a better finished vehicle  Still  for those who are looking for a cheaper alternative  I d be hard pressed not to recommend you at least give the XG300 a look  If it were me  and mind was set on the XG300  I d wait a year or two in hopes that build quality issues could be straightened out  if Hyundai came out with a  Sport  suspension and meatier tires  that d be nice  too b AVERAGE SCORE FOR THE XG300  7 14 out of 10  b VARA S PERSONAL RATING  7 0 out of 10  
Auto, I love my Highlander  We got the Limited and it is the most comfortable and smoothest riding SUV I have been in  The interior is set up well and everything is easy to get to  The in dash CD changer is a great option I would recommend  The seats are very comfortable and although I havent been a big fan of leather in the past these seats are great The engine is very quiet and gets good gas mileage for a 6 cyl SUV  While road noise is also minimal there is a strange aerodynamic issue when only the rear windows are rolled down  At highway speeds it sounds  and feels  like a helicopter is taking off  Opening one of the other windows or sun roof alleviates the problem though so for us it s a minor one The handling is also top notch for an SUV  It drives very much like a car  it should  it s on the Camery frame  and I have never felt like it wanted to roll over I had an Explorer  or  Exploder  as the Toyota salesman called them  previously and it was loaded with options so I do miss a few of the simple things I had before like a compartment just for Kleenex and a change dispenser  These are small items  but i consciously miss them now that I dont have them  But the ride of the Highlander never makes me miss the Explorer  
Camera, I received this camera as a gift  I had been wanting a digital camera for some time but I could not find my way through the maze of pixels and options  I have talked to friends  searched on ZDnet and other helpful websites  The decision making was the hardest part  The surprise gift made the choice a lot easier  After using this camera at a wedding I feel comfortable recommending it as a great place to start I love gadgets and love researching them as many of my gender does  There are so many cameras in this new market I found it hard to start looking  How many pixels do you need is the first question to answer  2 2 do a mighty fine job as it turns out  This camera has options for full and half resolution  Within these 2 levels there are an additional 3 levels of resolution  In my first few minutes with the camera I could see the difference on the LCD screen  With an 8MB Smartmedia card to start with  I chose the middle of the road  on both levels  to start  It has a great balance of clarity and storage  Once the wedding began I used the higher resolution settings and the pictures came out awesome  Of course the batteries had already been changed once Having battery options is another very nice feature of this camera  Since it flies through the juice  being able to use disposable or rechargeable batteries is a great option  I have a rechargeable battery kit now and will try to use this as the greenest solution whenever possible To be honest  I don t like to read really long reviews on Epinions so   I will summarize below The features of this camera I think are great are this 1 Smartmedia card storage   It is easy to use and small 2 USB cable interface   I know USB 2 is faster but this was still pretty fast for what I need 3 Uses regular AA batteries in either the alkaline or rechargeable format  You can always find AA batteries in a pinch  Try finding a photo specialized battery when you need one 4 LCD screen  you can review your pictures right away 5 Perfect resolution  2 2 mega pixel  options for a weekend vacation photographer  My kids look great in the pictures 6 You can watch the pictures on the TV with the other cables included  Pretty neat I thought 7 Power cord available to charge batteries in the camera 8 Easy to download pictures to the photo album software 9 Compact size Things I thought could be better 1 Battery consumption seems ferocious  I barely made it through a single 8MB card before I ran out 2 The LCD viewfinder is worthless for taking pictures at night  It works fine for viewing pictures anytime 3 The pixel resolution icons didn t  make sense at first  This from someone who does not like to use the instructions unless under duress  Once I figured it out it makes a lot more sense 4 It is hard to see through the standard viewer if you have a moderate sized nose  This aspect is inevitable when you go with a compact size  I can overlook it 5 The software included could be a bit easier to use  I can t imagine my techno phobic mother trying to figure out how to use the computer connection and software for this 6 You have to get used to the delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken  I got quite a few shots of the scene I moved my hands to not the scene I intended  Once you get the delay figured out it is really no big deal 7 There is no sound or movie option  There is a multi shot feature that makes a quasi movie  Overall this is a winner of a package for my first camera  I am sure I will want more in the future  By then I think I will be better able to afford all those cool features  For a simple high quality camera I like this one  
Auto, In late 2000  when my 1989 Toyota Celica started to die  I began the search for my new car  My prerequisites  Compact car  good ride  good warranty  and overall value  We had recently splurged on a 2000 Toyota Camry  and while we love that car  I was not willing to spend Camry type money on a car that would be my workhorse in commutes ind business trips  I also wanted a car that looked nice  and had some good bells and whistles  like power everything  cruise control  and a CD player  While I love Toyotas  I knew that those extra bells and whistles would cost too much Then along came the Hyundai  The reviews on the 2001 Hyundai Elantra were quite remarkable  with most reviewers saying that it was better than the Toyota Corolla  my first choice  The 2001 Elantra was newly redesigned  and the warranty could not be surpassed I was skeptical  until I took the car for a test drive  It took corners better than my Celica had  and its shocks   instead of struts   made for a smooth ride over bumpy terrain When it came time to negotiate  I was able to purchase the car for less than invoice  with the help of edmunds com  Edmunds showed me the rebates available on the car  including a  500 manufacturer rebate at the time I was looking to buy  Armed with the invoice price of every piece of optional equipment I sought to include on the car  the dealer soon agreed to my asking price  In this economy  the car buyer is king Real world driving of the Elantra is even better than the test drive  It is a very quiet car  even at high speeds  Acceleration is decent for an automatic  but it is my understanding that the car is even better as a 5 speed  The climate control on the air conditioner is good  maybe even a little too cold for my tastes at times  There is plenty of leg room in front and back  comfortably seating four tall men  The stereo system is good  and the optional CD player is a nice addition  While the cruise control is difficult to figure out  without reading the manual  it is easy to program while driving My only two critiques of the car are the front seats and the trunk  The front seats are narrower than other foreign cars  and the seatbelt is positioned irregularly  making it difficult to fasten while driving  which  of course  you shouldn t do anyway  My ample hips fit snugly in the bucket seats up front  but not uncomfortably The trunk is a little too narrow  and the trunk cover is made of cheap materials  This is surprising on a car which is very well made otherwise All in all  this is a great car  It is also a great looking car  which adds to its appeal  Although the resale value of it is questionable  for anyone looking to own a car for the long haul  it s a great deal  
Camera, As an avid photographer and writer on digital imaging  I bought this camera for day to day photography as well as to shoot images for my books and articles on Photoshop  After a couple of weeks shooting with it  I confess that I am totally hooked  and I may need to get a second one just to keep my boyfriend from stealing mine all the time Since I take a lot of action shots  primarily kids  I was very concerned about the shutter lag that is so common in digital cameras  I had shot with some other models and found them completely frustrating  Since I m used to shooting with an SLR  I expect the shutter to trip exactly when I hit the button  I m finding this is hardly a problem with the G2 I spent a few hours playing with and photographing my 10 month old nephew the other night and really had no complaints  The G2 offers a very good auto setting  the flash seems to perform very well most of my auto exposures have been dead on  It also offer program settings with exposure compensation  manual focus  etc  for those tricky to meter subjects  Metering and focusing works well and very intuitively One of my favorite features is the camcorder style  flip out LCD screen  This lets you use the camera from any conceivable angle with mimimal effort  When photographing kids  you can rotate the screen and shoot from waist height without even bending over  conversely  you can rotate the screen down and shoot with the camera over your head great for shots in crowds  It also rotates so you can take a self portrait Battery life has been impressive  We shot on Christmas day  maybe 200 shots at highest file size over the course of the day  with the LCD on and flash used on most shots  and didn t get a low battery warning for about 8 hours The camera software was also easy to install and works perfectly  even if  like me  you are too lazy to read the manual  Comes with a Photoshop plug in for importing photos that I like better than the Canon stand alone software  the plug in offers better titling options  Also  I installed this on a Mac running OS9 1  so Mac addicts should have no problems I ve made 8x10s that look very nice and feel I could probably go to 11x14 with good results I was a little resistant to going digital at last  but this was a terrific first experience I may finally have to give up my traditional darkroom  
Camera, You have probably seen many of your friends or family carrying around a digital camera at various functions  Digital cameras are great because you don t need to pay to develop film and you can e mail them to anyone or put them on a web page  Also  you can carry pictures around on a small disk and edit them at your leisure  In this review I am going to list the pros and cons that come along with purchasing this product  Since the cons outweigh the pros  you will understand why I don t recommend the Canon Powershot G1 digital camera PROS Battery Digital cameras use a lot of energy  In addition  many cameras either have a small battery  to save weight and cost  or are not supplied with rechargeable batteries  The G1 comes with a good sized LiIon battery  which is also used by some Canon camcorders  so it is fairly inexpensive  The battery is excellent  and you can take more than 500 pictures without having to recharge it  RAW File Format While the low compression JPEG files the camera produces are fine for snapshots  for serious work  where you will edit the image on computer  some kind of raw image format are necessary  Canon use a proprietary no loss compression scheme to achieve a sub 3Mb raw file size  Other companies produce TIFF files  which are much larger and waste valuable CF storage space and take longer to download  In easier terms  the RAW format uses 1 3 of the space an uncompressed TIFF uses  This feature is very useful  for you can set up white point  contrast  sharpness and saturation without losing any image quality  If you are taking critical pictures  this is the best feature that the camera has to offer Finally  the picture quality is very good  but so is the quality of pictures taken by most cameras in this price rage CONS Optical Viewfinder The viewfinder is small and ridiculously hard to use  It is a rip off that Canon s optical viewfinders are so poorly designed and constructed  most SONY cameras are equipped with vastly superior optical viewfinders  My biggest problem is that the viewfinder does not provide parallax compensation  Believe me when I say that despite all the good features that this camera has  the optical viewfinder problem makes this camera not worth the troubles it will cause you Cheap quality From the time I bought this camera  I knew it would not hold up  I take my camera everywhere I go  mostly outside  and although I have been careful  the G1 has very flimsy parts  I can also say that I have friends who own this camera and had parts break and even the camera itself has needed extensive repairs  If this is not enough to convince you not to buy this camera  read my conclusion Conclusion This camera has good features but so do other cameras that are cheaper in price  The price of digital cameras is dropping rapidly and I strongly urge you to wait until the price of better quality cameras go down  I cannot recommend the Canon Powershot G1 because I believe that for its price  799  it will become obsolete too fast  PLEASE  wait about half a year and purchase a better digital camera  Online stores such as www amazon com or www cnet com have great prices  However  if you must buy a camera now  check out the SONY digital cameras   Canon Powershot G1 Features  High resolution  3 34 million pixel CCD image sensor  Fast  3x optical zoom lens  34  102mm f 2 0  2 5  plus2x 4x digital zoom  Point and shoot simplicity with fully automatic focus  flash  and programmed exposure control   Multiple manual modes including  manual focus  manual exposure and manual white balance plus aperture priority AE and shutter priority AE   Mode Dial features12 EOS based picture taking modes   Movie recording and playback with sound   Dedicated digital signal processing IC  Integrated Chip plus memory buffer  Vari angle LCD monitor for easier handling and greater shooting flexibility  New system accessories including wide angle  telephoto  and macro lenses   Compatible with EOS dedicated EX series Speedlites   High capacity lithium ion power source  Canon USA 1 year warranty 
Camera, I ve only had this camera for 2 weeks but I am stunned at the quality of the photos it takes compared to my Kodak DC240  I have not played with many of the settings or the manual overrides as yet but in auto mode it takes superb photos   just pull it out of the box  put the batteries in and start snapping  Low light performance is just so much better than lesser cameras  It has a remote control too  Why  Hmmmm  not sure  but it s nice all the same  I d rather they had included something more useful such as rechargeable batteries and a recharger  Speaking of which You don t get any rechargeable batteries but since it can use AA s this is no big problem  You don t get a case either  and buying a small 3rd party case can be difficult because of the depth of the camera  It uses Smartmedia memory which I don t like because it s flimsy  slow  and more expensive than CompactFlash  The lens cap  a source of complaints with many cameras  is a pain because I keep forgetting to take it off before switching it on  It should also be tied to the body of the camera  so it s going to get lost sooner or later and probably sooner  This could have been easily rectified and is thus an unforgivable in my score sheet  Another niggle I have is that it can only output to NTSC or PAL depending on where you buy it  Other brands  such as Kodak  can output to both What you are buying here is a camera with little in the way of extras   but what a camera  
Camera, Here is my update I promised you  referring to my initial review titled  First Impression Wow  While reading this review keep in mind my saga with digital cameras  which started around Christmas time  Here is a quick refresher  With a new baby in the family I thought it would be nice to get mom a digital camera for Christmas  Not knowing much about digital cameras I spent 2 weeks going from store to store getting sales reps  opinions on cameras  The first camera I settled on was the 2 3 mega pixel Toshiba PDR M60  see my review on the Toshiba PDR M60  The Toshiba took excellent pictures but the camera casing felt cheap  Basically giving you the  I m gonna break when the warranty is up feeling  The Toshiba also used AA batteries which when taking pictures on high resolution lasts about 50 60 pics  even less with the screen on  I then traded the Toshiba in for a 1 3 mega pixel Sony DSC S30  The S30 came with a rechargeable battery and had a durable case  Overall I liked the S30 but the pictures  especially in doors and in low light  were not as crisps and clear as the Toshiba  In hopes of gaining better picture quality  plus the ability to take minute long videos  I returned the S30 and ordered the S50 from an online retailer  but that is another story all together  After my first weekend with the S50 I was impressed and left my first review titles  First Impression Wow  This is an update on that review The Sony DSC S50 is a great all around camera  Keep in mind the Toshiba and the Sony DSC S30 both cost  400  However the DSC S50 costs around  600  As far as durability and features you can not go wrong with the Sony  The rechargeable battery is the best  It really does last  I have taken almost 200 pics and 15 videos and still have 100 minutes of battery life left  The battery even recharges while still in the camera  While others have complained about Sony s flip screen monitor and the lack of a viewfinder  claiming that in bright conditions the screen is hard to see  I have not run into this yet and we have had some really sunny days in Florida  I also like how the buttons on the back of the camera are laid out  They allow for easy access while taking pictures or videos  The camera comes with plenty of features  too many to list  However the ability to record 1 minute long videos is great  While they are not the best quality they are perfect for email  Grandma cried when she saw her granddaughter eat cereal for the first time in a video I was able to send within minutes of the actual event  I do have one low point to the camera  We buy cameras to take pictures and the Sony S50 takes good pictures  However they are not excellent  If only the Sony S50 had the optics the Toshiba PDR M60 has  The S50 takes the same quality image as the S30  Simply put if you are looking for excellent quality images with clear resolution and bright vivid colors SAVE  200 and buy the Toshiba PDR M60  If the Toshiba had a better case or a rechargeable battery I would still own it  However is you are a gadget person who loves toys the DSC S50 is the camera for you  
Camera, When shopping for a digital camera  you probably want the most for your dollar right  Who doesn t  After doing exstensive research on cameras  finding this one was a blessing  While I could state a bunch of specs and fill this space with technical stuff  I m sure you can go to the Toshiba com web site for yourself  I wanted a camera that had would give me clear still pictures and short movies  Having never used a digital camera before  I wanted one that was REALLY easy to use  This one is menu driven  In short  I needed a camera that is simple enough to learn on  yet will allow me to take really awsome pictures if I ever get better at photography It s a simple camera in some resects  You can use it to just point and shoot  No worries about focusing though  it does that for you  You can set the flash to one spot and just leave it there  At this level  it basically acts kind of like a regular film camera Here s where it gets better You can set your flash to different levels to accomidate for stuff like low light   red eye reduction There are different modes that help you get the best pictures possible  While taking pictures of my toddler I found the burst mode to be incredibly helpful  It takes a series of pictures in quick sucession  Good for moving subjects and if you ve ever tried to get a toddler to sit still for a picture you can see how handy this is  If you get really good  there s a manual mode so you can mess around with settings drawbacks Unfortunatly there is quite a delay from when you push the button to when the camera actually takes the picture  While annoying  it s easily worked around  Low lighting makes it almost impossible to shoot using your LCD screen  Movie mode  You can do it in low light but your movie might suck  The battery has a decent life  Being rechargable is good  yet bad  If you re out some where and your battery dies  unless you have another one or use your adapter  you re out of luck  On the plus side  we all know how expensive it can get when you have to buy batteries all the time  What I got with my camera With my camera I recived a 8 meg  smart media  card  a lens cap  a carry strap  and software  The software is really cool and makes getting your pics easy  You just  get images  Extras I did buy a LCD screen protector  After a few uses I found that my thumb always seems to end up on the screen  Not wanting to dirty or scratch my screen I got a proctector that I can replace if I have to  I also bought a camera bag for it since the thought of haveing my investment floating around wasn t appealing  Screen protector  about  10 off ebay  Camera bag I think was  20 or so off the Toshiba web site  I also bought another media card  I got a 32 meg card and it didn t cost more than what I would have spent in a month for film and developing Picture stuff  I keep my Camera set to take 800X600 pics  That s  medium  size  I have it set at medium quiality  This allows me to take a good amount of pics and not have them look crummy 800X600 is what most people have thier computer screen resoultion set at  Macro setting can get you VERY close  I was able to take some neat pics of the inside of a flower without it getting blurry  Overall  I think the pictures are crispy looking and FAR better than my 35mm film camera More extras There s a ton of other stuff you can buy to add to your camera  Do you really like the  floppy disk  idea  You can get a floppy that you plug your media into and get your pics that way  You can get tripods  lenses  bags  faster rechargers  bigger media cards  There s no shortage of accesories to buy if you want more add ons Durability  Well  I don t know about that as I ve never dropped my camera  I really don t think it would withstand a lot of abuse though  My little brother had a very expensive untill he dropped it about 4 feet  Now he has a very exspenive paper weight  As long as you hold on to your camera for dear life and don t drop it  I think it ll last for a long time Overall I think it s a great camera  It s few drawbacks are easily worked around  I bought my camera as a refurbished model from the Toshiba web site  The price was definetly right  It has a lot of options and quality for the price tag  
Camera, When I was in the market for a digital camera  two years ago now  I had researched a lot of different cameras  but the Kodak DC 215 stood out among the competition with its then excellent features and an overall great deal  Two years later  I am still a  semi happy DC215 owner  but if you re thinking about getting this camera now  think again  Why  you may ask  Because at this point  this camera s features are outdated  and it is almost obsolete  Want the details Kodak DC215 features a 1 megapixel CCD with a 2x optical zoom  While this was more than enough then  today s cameras far outgrow those specifications  But  if you aren t looking for that kind of precision  you MAY be satisfied by this camera The zoom worked great  until I had a little accident with the camera  hit the lens against a table  not too hard  but enough to offset the focus for good There are some major shortcomings about the quality of pictures in this camera  For example  action shots  ANY movement  shows up as a smear in the picture  Also  do not try to take any pictures at night of anything further than 6 feet from the camera  you just won t see anything The connection to the computer is through a serial cable  and with the size of the pictures  it takes forever to link up to the camera and download the pictures  You d be better off purchasing a Compactflash card reader  and use the USB connection The battery life of this camera is non existent  if you use the LCD screen to preview review your pictures  If so  expect about 5 minutes runtime from the 4 AA batteries that go into this thing  However  if you don t use the screen  you can get a decent amount of pictures taken without problems These are by far not all of the pros cons of the camera  just the ones that are the most obvious to me as a 2 year owner of the unit  I have to say that I ve taken tons of good pictures with it  but being a scrutinizing gadget person  I m annoyed with this camera s shortcomings  and looking to get something better down the road If you find that this camera will do  buy it  But if you want fast downloads  long battery life  and high quality pictures  stay away from this one  
Auto, The Dodge Viper is in a class all by itself  With its Michelin MXX3 performance tires  standard power mirrors and satin finish aluminum interior trim it is a must have vehicle for anyone willing to part with over 76 000 dollars  The Dodge Viper comes in two different models  the RT 10 2 Dr Convertible and the GTS 2 Dr Coupe  Although the Coupe is a little more spendy  76 793  both models are state of the art  This vehicle will amaze the driver both in its handling and in its performance  The Viper is so smooth and so easy to drive that it practically drives itself  This car is guaranteed to turn the eyes of passers by and spice up the love life of the lucky owner  If for no other reason I would buy this vehicle simply because of how well it performs and how exciting it is to drive  I would compare driving this vehicle with floating in space  The ride is that smooth  Unlike most cars that have a hard time taking rough corners or stop and go in a jerky manner  the Dodge Viper accelerates  turns  and stops in a remarkably smooth fashion  It literally defies the rules of physics  The negatives about the Dodge Viper besides the price is that it gets poor gas mileage and offers a limited amount of cargo room  The large increase in insurance that is bound to coincide with the purchase of this vehicle is another factor that should influence the buying decision of the consumer  All in all  the Dodge Viper is an amazing vehicle that is a must have for anyone searching for the ideal sports car br br  
Camera, The Kodak EasyShare CX6230 is a good personal digital camera  The camera is inexpensive  between  120 140  it s sturdy  and very easy to use  The CX6230 camera is a good many extras for the price  The camera has a zoom lens  night time mode  burst mode  for taking several quick shot pictures  and an easy to follow menu option and review mode  The camera comes with the USB hook up cable and also included are cables for TV picture viewing  The docking cradle is included if one wishes to purchase the picture printing unit  which is an available option  After using this camera  I find it to be very easy to use and manage  The pictures are easily downloaded to one s personal computer  The pictures are of good quality  Managing the photo albums and pictures are very user friendly  The manual and menu options on the camera are very well explained  Within about fifteen minutes I was using the camera  and having no problems  The camera is compact  about the size of a disposable camera  It is a sturdy camera  not fragile  or overly sensitive  The camera internal memory will take and save about twenty one pictures before downloading  By purchasing a memory card  they vary in size  one can add the memory capacity by 150 250 pictures before having to download  This is a wonderful  inexpensive  digital camera and a great digital camera for the novice  or as a beginners camera  Digital cameras give the user so many more options than traditional cameras  and the Kodak EasyShare CX6230 is a great digital camera for one to initiate themselves into the world of digital photography  
Camera, I ve entered the world of digital photography  What can I say  I was a first mover with the whole CD burning craze but have been slow on the digital photography revolution  Actually  I have a confession  I m reviewing a product which was lent to me  Anyway with the advent of internet based services that allow you to send the photos to a photo processing shop and get them printed out on  real  picture paper I am much more likely to adopt  The whole idea of being able to take pictures and then view them on the spot will save a lot in film costs  Additionally  the thing is super user friendly  even my mother who is not exactly a technically inclined individuals has no problem using it  But enough of this on to the specs Brand Sony  It s a Sony and as such you can expect quality but also price  I have had it recommended to me to have a non Sony bag to disguise the value of the camera  but then again they don t even include a camera case in the purchase price Weight  0 59 pounds  Don t loose it  it s a cell phone type weight Accessories  Rechargeable AA NiMH Batteries  Battery Charger  AV Cable  USB Cable  Wrist Strap  16 MB Memory Stick  Software CD ROM Key Features Sony Memory Stick   16 MB  What the hell good is that  go an buy a big honking stick which can take 100 pictures  sadly you ll have to pay more since it s Sony memory LCD Size   1 5 in   Yeah it s small but the whole thing is small Optical Zoom   3X Resolution   5 Meg pixels  Wouldn t have it any other way Photos can be one of five resolutions  2 592 x 1 944 pixels 2 592 x 1 728 pixels  3 4  2 048 x 1 536 pixels 1 280 x 960 pixels 640 x 480 pixels  VGA Best Feature  Night time non flash images that end up looking like what you see when you are looking at something in the dark  Very impressive Feature that you don t really need  The fact that it can do  Megamovie VX  movies  I have a digital movie camera and I don t really need my digital camera to take movies too The transferring of pictures onto computer is a snap too  I plug the USB cable into the camera and then the other end into the computer  turn the camera on and then boom  can swap the pictures from the memory stick to my hard drive  The pictures I took were in the range of 1   2 megs in size so you may need a program such as Adobe in order to cut down the file size before you email your pictures to friends and relatives While a non technical person can easily use this camera  there are features for the more adventurous  Features like the  three shot burst  mode which will allow you to  just as the name implies  take three shots in close succession Plus I love the ability to just plug the camera into the front of my TV  I find that I need to see the picture on the big screen in order to see if I should keep it or not It s a pricy camera but I know that it s on my Christmas list  
Auto, Saab 9 5 2 3L Stick I must confess  one of the main reasons I ended up buying the Saab over a 328 was because the dealer cut me an insane deal on the 99 s going out  While it is  not  as sporty as I would want it to be  I would still call it a great Car if you cannot afford a 540i or a A6 2 7 Turbo  Handles better than it feels  does give you an indication of body roll  Highway cruising is GREAT  the Car is rock stable even at speeds  gt  120 MPH  Pickup in the 0 60 department could be better  but passing feels better than most cars I have driven including sports cars  Possible due to the full of torque available in the 1800 to 4000 RPM range  Anyone  who is sick of seeing tiny BMWs 3 series are Sub Compacts  and Acura TLs getting stuffed into their parking lot Neighbourhood should get a 9 5  Be Different  Some say the Saab has a higher snob factor than a bimmer  if that does anything for you I also find it a better drive than the 9 3s I test drove  My other Car is a Honda Prelude SH VTEC screamer  so I had high expectations while looking for a sedan  Things I don t like  hate the gear shift  and the slight body roll  I beleive the roll is a cheap fix and it is easy to boost the Turbo to get me north of 200 HP out of this  though I am not sure I will need it I have currently leased it  and am tempted to buy if off  Oh Yes  I have a base with all the SE options  leather  sunroof  seats etc except the Harmon Kardon Stereo  get that  the BASE stereo is not that great     
Auto, Excellent  Body design is excellent and I have never seen a ding or a dent in this car s body  The interior is very roomy in the front seating  However  the back seat is made only for small children  This has not been a problem since I alone drive the car and sometimes just one front passenger  This car is perfect for one or two adults  I think it was mean for adults  It is the best choice for a family car is your kids are over the age of ten  One thing to note though is that this car is very conmfortable on trips and also around town  Inside the ride is comfortable and very quiet  This 4 cylinder rides like an 8 to me with lots of pep  yet it is hard to hear the road noise in town or on a trip  A very enjoyable car to own  
Camera, After 3 months of research looking for a digital camera to take on vacation  I selected the Epson PhotoPC 850Z because it had the most bang for the buck  I was pleasantly surprised with it  I ve gotten so many compliments on my pictures  which never happened with my film camera pictures  I d never owned a digital camera before this  and it had a wonderful out of the box experience  Just stick the batteries in and go to town  The manuals are clear and easy to understand  as is the operation of the camera itself  You get all the necessary cables and software to download pictures to you computer  I ve used it with both a PC and a Mac  and like the PC version better although there is not much difference  I would suggest that anyone purchasing this camera also buy an extra memory card  because they will be taking pictures for the sheer enjoyment of it after seeing what this camera can do  I liked my camera so much that when my boss asked me to buy one for work  I got another Epson PhotoPC 850Z  Everyone at work fights over who gets to use  play with  it It s great for indoor and outdoor pictures  moving or still  and is perfect for taking pictures to post on a web site  Quality is excellent br br  
Camera, This was my first digital camera  purchased in August 1999  it hooked me on the digital camera concept  but not on this camera in particular This model is easy to use  Point and click  On board review is nice  and you can delete photos right at the camera if the shot is no good  The memory that comes with the camera holds 64 photos easily that are good enough for viewing in the internet  or about 8 high quality prints  Some fun features include built in frames and date printing The downfall of this camera is the print resolution  You can t even print even the better quality photos at bigger than 4 by 6 inches  I upload a lot of my pictures to ofoto com to have real prints made of them  and the biggest you can get uploads to come out clear there is 3 by 5 from this camera Connection is slow and I had trouble with the camera disconnecting after a certain number of transferred pictures  The Adobe software that accompanies the camera is easy to learn  but takes up quite a bit of drive space while in use   don t plan on playing a game in the background while you are cropping and editing pictures  A card reader  sold for about  30 seperately  is a smart investment  makes for faster upload This is a good starter camera  very easy to use  My six year old son took good pictures with this model  I put about 1000 pictures on this camera  it keeps count of how many times the camera has been used  mostly for things I sell on ebay  and this camera is perfect for that  Camera is sturdy  I dropped it a few times  oops  on tile floor and the worst thing that ever happened was the batteries popped out Get recharging batteries  this camera eats them in about 60 pictures   takes 4 AA br br  
Camera, This is my first digital camera What sold me was the features  I liked the fact that the camera uses regular AA batteries  not a pricey proprietary battery like some cameras do  So in a pinch you can find batteries anywhere You can buy rechargeable nickel metal hydride  DON T use NiCads  batteries and a charger inexpensively at Radio Shack  I also like the fact the camera uses Compact Flash memory cards  Again  widely available  This camera can use up to a 128 meg card Some cameras only have internal memory  which means when you fill up the memory  you can t take any more pictures until you download them to your computer and erase them from the camera s memory It also has a 3X optical zoom  A digital only zoom basically just crops the picture  so the resolution suffers  The camera also has a lot of settings that can be defined by the user  Flash  white balance  power settings  etc  It s got a lot of options but better have your manual handy until you get familiar with them all It also comes with a USB cable so you can download the photos to your computer  And the Canon software is pretty decent  I thought that a 1 3 megapixel camera would not produce quality photos  but I was pleasantly surprised  At the highest resolution setting  this camera takes excellent  sharp pictures  A friend of mine recently enlarged several of my shots to 8x10  and printed them out on his printer at work on photo paper The results were amazing I had always read that you couldn t enlarge pictures taken with a 1 3 megapixel camera beyond 4x6  and even that was stretching it Don t believe it The 8x10 s he made were sharper than the 4x6 prints I usually get using 400 ASA film This camera will take pictures in near total darkness  but shots taken in poor light will tend to be somewhat grainy However  the quality of pictures taken in decent light is impressive  The results are crisp  clear  well exposed and have nicely saturated colors  The battery life is about average  and there is a fair amount of parallax error when you are using the viewfinder instead of the LCD  The LCD can be hard to see in bright light  also If you are looking for your first digital camera  you absolutely cannot go wrong with one of these  It s loaded with features and won t cost an arm and a leg Canon has discontinued this model  and they can be had cheap  if you can find one I love this camera  
Camera, First off  the picture associated with this camera on epinions com is not a picture of the Vivitar 3745  For an actual picture of the 3745  go to vivitar com  I researched this camera and couldn t find any reviews  but it had all of the options that I was looking for so I figured that for the price  it would be a good deal   I was wrong  I purchased this camera on walmart com  For  229 I got both the Vivitar 3745  a 3 1 mega pixel camera  and a free 128 MB SD card  Delivery was cheap and fast   I ordered on a Thursday night and received it the following Tuesday morning  The cost of 2 day shipping was less than  5  This was my first digital camera and I was looking for something to supplement my 5 year old automatic Canon 35mm camera  I m not a photography expert  so I just wanted something that was simple to use and took pictures that would be somewhat comparable to my Canon 35mm   For the last 4 years I have been paying to have all of my 35mm pictures put on disks when I get them developed  My goal with going to a digital camera was to save money on developing by putting the pictures on a disk myself and only having the best pictures printed Included in the package were digital photo editing software  the camera  a camera case  a lens cap  a wrist strap  a cord to connect the camera to your PC via a USB port  a cord to connect the camera to your TV via a RCA connection  and 4 AA alkaline batteries  The 128 MB SD Card  which I believe was a walmart com exclusive deal  shipped separately  but arrived on the same day When you first turn on the camera  you have to enter the date and time  which was easy to do  but unfortunately  this had to be done every time that you changed the batteries  and I had to change the batteries often  The menus on the camera were easy to use and I liked the fact that in addition to the picture preview LCD screen on the back of the camera  the top of the camera had a small screen which displayed the image resolution  the number of remaining pictures that could be taken at that resolution  and the remaining battery life  If the indicator was correct  you could take around 140 pictures at the highest quality resolution on a 128 MB card  In addition to taking still photos  the camera also allows you to take video without sound in the Quicktime format  a 128 MB SD card will hold about five and a half minutes worth of video  I  owned  this camera for a week and took about 150 different still pictures in various settings  inside  outside  and in various lighting  and about 12 different short videos  All of the still pictures  regardless of the lighting  were dark and pixelated looking  The videos were somewhat pixelated  but they seemed to be of better quality than the still pictures   I expected a degree of pixelization on the videos  After all  this is a still camera and the ability to shoot video is a nice bonus  but not the real purpose of the camera  When my first few pictures came out somewhat pixelated  I thought that maybe I was using the wrong image resolution setting  but that wasn 146t the case and no matter which image resolution setting I used  my pictures were dark and pixelated  The camera 146s built in flash didn t seem to make any difference in the picture quality  I took a number of pictures at night in my living room  a room that is around 15 X 20 feet  Regardless of whether the flash was used or not  my pictures were dark and pixelated  I thought that maybe the pictures would be better once I downloaded them onto my PC  I hooked the camera up to my PC via a USB port  Downloading pictures from the camera to the PC was quick and didn t require any special software  my operating system is Windows ME  But the picture quality only appeared worse on my PC  The included photo editing software was adequate  very similar to most of the other photo editing software out there  but nothing to get excited about  I tried editing and improving my photos using the included software  Microsoft Picture It  and Kodak Easyshare  No matter which program I used  my pictures were dark and pixelated and nothing seemed to improve them  Hooking the camera up to my 32 inch TV 146s RCA connector in order to view pictures on the TV was easy to accomplish  but something seemed to cause interference and in addition to being dark and pixelated  the pictures when viewed on the TV also looked  147fuzzy 148 and would fade in and out The 4 AA alkaline batteries that came with the camera lasted about 20 pictures  I changed to rechargeable Ni MH batteries and could take about 30 pictures prior to having to change batteries  and thus having to re enter the date and time with each battery change  The shutter button was very unresponsive at times  I sometimes had trouble knowing whether or not I had taken a picture and had to stop and use the review function in order to see if I had gotten the shot  When taking video  you use the shutter button to start and stop the video  but sometimes I had to push the button 5 or 6 times before I could get it to start or stop the video  Other times the camera would lock up when switching between video and still picture modes and the only way I could get the camera to work again was to take out the batteries  and then I had to re enter the date and time  After a week I had had enough and took the camera back to my local Wal Mart  I was out the shipping cost  less than  5  but I learned an important lesson about buying a cheap camera  you usually get what you pay for  This time I bought a Kodak 6340 for  279 and so far  I couldn t be happier with it  The sad thing about the Vivitar 3745 is that I really liked the layout of the camera  The functions were very intuitive  Less than a minute after taking it out of the box  I was taking pictures and I quickly figured out the majority of the functions before opening the manual latter that night  Unfortunately  all of the pictures that I took using the Vivitar 3745 weren t very good and nothing I did seemed to improve their quality  I had to sit down and read the instruction manual before I felt comfortable using my new Kodak 6340  which only took about half an hour to read cover to cover  The Kodak doesn t have as many manual settings as the Vivitar  but every picture that I ve taken with it so far is excellent and I ve already taken about 100 still pictures and a half dozen short videos  with sound  on the original set of batteries    
Auto, When purchasing our Ford Windstar in early 1999 we looked at the brand new ones and then saw a  quot leftover quot  from 98  It was exactly what we wanted at the time we didn t think we needed dual sliding doors in retrospect I regret not getting them  I will start by saying the van has never had service problems  gets decent gas mileage  and runs pretty smoothly  My biggest gripe is the turning radius  I have a VERY hard time parking this vehicle in parking lots  So much so that I now look hard for two spots together so I know i have plenty of room to  quot make the turn quot  Another minor gripe is the sound of rattling coming through the console at times seems like something wasn t sealed tight enough  I love the reliability of the 98 Windstar  I love the 5 star safety rating that it received  It rode very well on the many 6 hour trips back and forth from Virginia to New Jersey  All in all it s a great van that I would recommend to others just beware of the parking troubles I have with it     
Camera, I had originally bought the Sony DSC S70 but after a week and a half of use and a little more research I decided to exchange it for the DSC F505V  Don t get me wrong  the S70 is an excellent camera  I just wanted a little upgrade and a few more features that the F505V offered The F505V has an AWESOME design  You ll definitely get a lot of oohs and ahhs from your friends when you pull this baby out  You ll really impress them when you show them the pictures that you captured with it  Unbelievable picture quality  I was more than impressed when I received my prints  They came out beautiful Here are some of the great features the F505V has to offer  1  Beautiful pictures  Vivid Colors  Sharp images  Can t say enough really 2  Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar Optical 5x zoom lens  Gorgeous  Carl Zeiss optics are the best in the business 3  Rotating lens body  Another reason I traded in my S70  This really helps when you are in need of taking a photo at an awkward angle  Like ground shots or over a crowd of heads   4  Manual Focus  Macro  and a superior White Balance setting 5  Lithium Ion Battery   I hate having to purchase AAA s or AA s 6  effective 2 6 MegaPixels with interpolation  before compression  to 3 7 7  MPEG movies  with sound  as opposed to Nikon 990 8  Good selection of program modes  Aperture Priority  Shutter Priority  Night  Spot etc  9  USB Connectivity 10  52mm lens thread  Rarely talked about but this makes it really easy to find attachment lenses and filters 11  That design is awesome  Looks so futuristic  Nice LCD too Ok  now for some of the cons of this camera 1  No viewfinder 2  Not a true 3 3 MegaPixel Cam  effective 2 6 3  Comes with a pathetic 8mb memory stick  64MB mem stick is a must 4  Battery Life is not as long as S70 s So there you have it  I have had my Sony Cybershot F505V for about a month now and I m absolutely loving it  And because it s so small and light I take it everywhere I go The settings and controls on this cam take a little getting used to  as with most manual cams I assume  But if you decide to purchase this cam take the time to learn all the nice features  After seeing the kinds of pics you can take you won t regret it I recommend this camera to anyone in love with photography  It s manual settings and functions allow for some spectacular day and night photos  If all you are going to use it for is a straight point and shoot cam  save your money  This camera has too much firepower and is quite pricey br br  
Camera,   Intro  This is a 2 1 megapixel digital camera from Canon  It has a magnesium body and is pretty small and light weight  It takes multi media flash cards and can even take the IBM Microdrive  which is something like 1 Gig of space  I currently have a 48 meg card in it and that allows me to take 70  1600x1200 pictures  That s 70 pictures  The Good  I bought my camera around x mas 1999 and haven t looked back since  There isn t anything new on the market that I can see that can beat it besides the Canon S110 which is a bit smaller Picture quality  I take all of my pictures at 1600x1200 resolution  The color quality seems to be well balanced and it seems to pick up lighting very well  I am not a professional photographer but if I was I don t think I would be using a digital camera anyway  Features  This thing is jam packed full of features  Most of them I don t even use  I pretty much switch in between manual mode  to turn off the flash  and auto mode  to activate the flash  I just point and shoot  I have used the timer delay on occasion and haven t had much use for the micro feature  which allows you to take closeup pictures with great detail Also  it should be noted that this thing is put together very well  It has been dropped  leaving a nice dent in the corner of it but absolutely nothing has gone wrong with it  The Bad  The battery life isn t the greatest with this thing  Around 50 pictures it is toast  I am definitely glad that I bought and extra battery with it  It s been a life saver  The Ugly  There is none  
Camera, We bought the Polaroid PDC640 because it was affordable but had good features  I LOVE this camera and take it almost everywhere  It comes with a handy pouch to keep it clean  which is nice and practical  It comes with a 2MB disc  which I believe can be replaced by a bigger one for more storage  A cool feature is that the photos can be run through your television  I love the fact that it comes with the Photomax software too  which makes the whole upload process effortless  Pictures can be labeled and saved  then used for screensavers  desktops  attached to emails  used on stationery  etc  So many possibilities  The pictures are clean and crisp  color accurate  and just beautiful  I can t say enough about this camera  For the money  you get a lot of camera  The only regret I have is that the PDC 640 has no zoom feature  But I guess I only desire because the pictures are truly wonderful  If you are lousy about taking photos in to get them developed at the photo lab  like I am  then this will pay for itself time and time again  Wonderful camera br br  
Auto, Here is another example of my husband s obsession with Nissans  But once again  I have no complaints about it  This is a fast 4 cylinder car  other than the Neon  that saves money in your pocketbook  It saves on gas and it is really stylish for such a low price tag  From it s sleek body to it s easy to add on dash  this car has a lot of positives about it  A good thing about this car is the handling  which is a smooth  carefree ride all the way from start to destination finish  Also  the quiet engine and top notch acceleration makes you feel like your in a 6 cylinder car br br  
Auto, My Odyssey is 6 months old and has 10 000 miles At 2500 miles the following phenomenon took place Traveling at 50 mph  when accelerating to a higher speed  the engine made a sound that can best described as like a diesel  The sound disappears when a steady speed is maintained  It has gotten progressively worse I took it to the Honda dealer twice to complain about the situation  The service manager told me that there had been a few similar complaints  but upon checking with Honda Service reps or home office  or whomever they check with  they do not have an explanation  He assured me that it does not affect the performance of the vehicle  In his words   quot It s the nature of the beast quot I have checked with several Odyssey owners and they all state that they have not experienced the problem  The noise the engine makes is annoying  but the local Honda dealer  doesn t seem to be able to or seem to want to do anything about  I want to take this to a higher level and get some satisfaction  and would like some information on where to turn to Any help will be greatly appreciated Sid    
Camera, This is the first digital camera I ve owned  I ve briefly used friends  in the past and learned how wonderful these things are  So this year I finally got one as a present  Nonetheless  I m not exactly an electronic guru  I just know the simple facts  as an average user b POWER b  So I get an awesome digital camera as a gift  and what do I do  Take it out of the box and begin snapping away  No  The Sony DSC 171 uses 2 AA rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries  which are included  with a recharger  And it takes up to 13 hours to charge them  NOTE  The manual specifies that the Sony DSC 171 cannot be used with regular AA alkaline batteries  So unless you also bought the AC adapter  or happen to have some fully charged Nickel Metal Hydride AA batteries handy  you have to wait about 13 hours while the batteries charge before you can use your camera  But I do like the fact that the camera comes with a recharger  The camera can also be used with an AC power adapter  but that is not included and must be purchased separately  The manual suggests that you use the AC adapter when downloading your photos or printing them  so the camera does not shut off in the middle of the process   FYI  I didn t get one  And when the camera runs out of batteries  it shuts off without retracting and closing the lens   and you can t retract or close the lens until you replace the batteries  So be sure to turn your camera off as soon as you get the low battery warning  or else you could be stuck with your lens open and sticking out  which can be inconvenient   MEMORY    The pictures you take are stored on a teeny little thing called a Memory Stick  which is shorter than a stick of gum  The camera comes with a 16mb Memory Stick  which stores about  96 of 640x480 pictures 16 of 1600x1200 pictures 10 of 2048x1536 pictures  Not a comprehensive list  but just to give you an idea   I eventually bought another Memory Stick  128mb  which cost about  80 00   LOOKING AT YOUR PICTURES    To get the pictures from your camera onto your computer  so you can e mail or print them  you can use the Video Out port and the included USB cable  Before you do this  you need to install a USB driver  which is on the enclosed CD ROM   This is quite easy  and should take just a few minutes   If you have a Sony computer  you can also just remove the Memory Stick and pop it right into your computer  You can also look at your pictures on a television with the included RCA video cable  Instant slide show of your vacation pictures anywhere there is a television   PICTURE QUALITY    The Sony DSC 171 has a resolution of 3 2 Megapixels  I m not sure exactly what this means  but it appears that the more Megapixels you have  the better your picture quality  Without much experience with other digital cameras  all I can say is that my pictures look really great  When I print them on photo paper using my ink jet printer  they look almost as good as a 35mm print to me   great colors and crisp images  I did have a chance to compare my Sony photos with the photos I took with the Polaroid PDC 640  which has less than 1 Megapixel   and what a world of difference   ZOOM    The Sony DSC 171 has an Optical Zoom of 3X and and Digital Zoom of 2X  for total zoom power of 6X  I think the 160mm zoom on my 35mm camera was a little more powerful  but the 6X zoom on the Sony DSC 171 is just fine for what I need   DESIGN   EASE OF USE    The camera is a good  compact size  and fits nicely in my hand  And all the controls  like the Mode Dial  the Control Button  and the Zoom Button  are well placed and comfortable to use  I also had no trouble with the menu  or the other functions of the Sony DSC 171  After just a few minutes with the manual  it was easy to figure out how to do everything I wanted  I was able to begin using the camera right away  once the batteries were charged  that is  So this camera is easy to use  even for a newbie like me   MOVIE    I was surprised to discover that you can record little movies with the Sony DSC 171  which you can download as MPEG files onto your computer  There is no sound  and the picture quality isn t great  so it s hardly a substitute for a camcorder  and nothing more than a fun little gimmick  But it s handy if you ever want to send a little digital footage via e mail   MISC    Aside from the initial cost of the camera  I expect that most people will want to invest in some accessories to enhance their use of the camera  Memory Stick  128mb    about  80 90 each Extra Ni MH batteries   about  6 8 for a package of 2 Case  Model LCS CP2    about  20 from sonystyle com AC adapter   about  40 from sonystyle com All in all  I m really happy with the Sony DSC 171  This will be a great  convenient way to keep and share my memories for a long time to come  
Camera, The D 340R is by far one of the best entry level Digital Cameras  The pictures are always crisp and the colors are very lifelike  The SmartMedia cards provide a quick and efficient storage method  The cards themselves are small enough to be kept in a small space  I bought a compact carrying case from a local camera shop with a pouch just large enough for the SmartMedia Cards  This camera takes Megapixel images  has autofocus  autoflash  and a color LCD display  It has everything you could want from a camera for  299  The Macro mode allows you to take close ups of small items while retaining amazing details  This is simply an all around good camera br br  
Auto, I bought my Pontiac Sunfire back in March of 99 when i moved and needed a car of my own  I shopped it around of course till i found the perfect one which had all the things on it i wanted  It s the SE but came with the bigger engine which is actually in the GT model  I think for the price i got it for and for my use it is the perfect car  A few downfalls of the car are the cup holders suck in the car  The one in the front seat isn t deep enough so if i have a drink in it and i m not careful the drink will tip over because it doesn t fit in it well  There are 2 cup holders in the back seat but they don t seem to hold drinks very well in it either  Another thing that is annoying is that the driver s seat has a lumbar support in it that is supposed to make the seat more comfortable but it actually makes it harder on the back  I think the passenger seat is more comfortable than the driver s seat  What i do like about this car is even though the car itself is small it does have some good amount of space in it in terms of the trunk the back seat folds down to make more room for bigger things if i need to transport big things in my car  Another cool thing is the glove compartment is HUGE  It is bigger than any glove compartment i ve seen on bigger cars i ve been in  Only one bad thing about it is there is no lights in the glove compartment like there is in  in most glove compartments  Another good thing is that for the size of the car it sure does have good power and can definitely  quot get out of it s own way quot  All in all i think the car is good for the money  I had also test drove the chevy cavalier when car shopping and i definitely think the sunfire is the better car and give a better ride and is more comfortable to ride in br br  
Auto, I was driving my  81 BMW since it was new and was just pouring money into it to keep it running  I knew I wanted a small SUV and had been searching all of them  My search kept taking me to the Honda CR V  For months I would search the internet  go to dealerships and resale lots  I read Consumer Reports and Edmunds com reports  Again  I kept coming up with the CR V  I was going to buy a new one  but a wellknown financial guru recommended not buying new  but buy a used car 1 2 yrs old  because of the the depreciation  I bought a red 1998 LX 5 speed manual  4X4 wheel drive and I love it  It is very smooth and has much better get up and go than the automatics  It is very roomy inside and the radio sound quality is good  The cruise control is great  I sit alot higher now and can finally see on the road  The car does have some blind spots  especially with the drivers head rest in place  The gas mileage is good  especially when the A C is not running I cannot wait for the first snow storm to see what everyone is talking about br br  
Auto, I recently purchased a 2000 ML430 brand new from the local dealer  I had a second hand  89 260E that I wanted to trade in for a truck  Having been around Mercedes for quite a while  I opted for the ML 430  I have  and still do  owned several Mercedes Benz automobiles over the past 13 years including an  87 300E   88 560SEL   97 SL500   97 S500 I have owned the ML430 for about 2 weeks now and unfortunately it has spent 8 days in service  The SRS light turned and stayed on during day number 3  I brought in the truck 1st thing Monday morning  Later that afternoon  my serviceman called saying they would have to order a new computer module  I didn t get the car back until Friday that week  Later that Friday afternoon  the SRS light turned on again and wouldn t go off  This week  I brought back the ML for repair again  Today  Wednesday  my serviceman has replaced all the airbags thinking that was the problem  but the light is still on and they can t figure it out  Now  my serviceman says he will be bringing in the Regional Service Manager to help out and the Shop Foreman who has been out of town  If they can t figure it out  my serviceman says he ll probably have to replace the truck  Again  I have owned several Mercedes Benzes that have been mostly reliable with only minor problems occurring now and then  This is a nightmare so far  Unfortunately  these ML s are unlike previous Benzes in one respect  They re made in the good old U S  of A  I suspect that American quality control is not nearly as good as the German control  For example  my  87 300E has 120 000 miles on it and never has had electronic problems such as this  Sure  the air conditioning on the 300 needed some repair and the transmission was replaced at 100 000 miles  but no other major problems that Mercedes couldn t figure out On the good side  this ML drives very well and has plenty of power  It handles quite well for a truck  Much better than any domestic truck I have driven  i e  Suburban  Denali  It s not too big  but big enough for daily tasks and occassional off roading  We drove through some gravel roads in the mountains at 60 mph and it felt solid as a rock  All in all  with my limited  but eye opening experience it drives like a Mercedes  but certainly is not reliable  If this SRS problem is indicative of what the future of this truck may be like  I might just have to apply my State s Lemon Law and ask for my money back br br  
Auto, This car really has me spoiled  It will probably outlive me  Seriously   my  93 Toyota Corolla has really been worth every cent I originally spent on it  I bought it used   in 1994  It was my first car  I read all the reviews for cars in it s class and it seemed to be the best value for the cost  It has lived up to all my expectations  My little Corolla has been so reliable for me   it has never broken down on me   never left me stranded anywhere  It s been as far North as New York  I live in Ohio  and as far south as South Carolina   with 0 problems  Besides the usual maintenance and replacements  tires  brakes  I haven t really had to do much with it  It s still got about as much zip in it as when I first got it  It still looks good   no problems with rust yet  even in our nasty winters  I still love the look of it   much better than the latest models  The inside is just as good as the outside   nice looking interior  The controls are easy to reach and to work  My automatic transmission has it s gear shift on the floor  It s convenient and easy to use  I get great mileage too  The heating system keeps the car cozy when it s needed and the a c does it s job just as well  There is plenty of leg room up front and in the back   comfortable for four people  There is plenty of room in the trunk as well The only drawback might be if you re looking for a huge interior  It s just right for four people to fit in comfortably  A fifth person could squeeze into the back but it gets a little tight  For a compact car though   it really is adequate  Overall I really can t say enough about it  I love this car   I would definitely buy it all over again br br  
Camera, I ve been using this camera for an year and hence my comments are not from the first look  but from usage of several months If you are looking for a camera which has the best dollar per pixel value  then this is the winner But  if you are looking for convenience  durability  good quality pictures for all light conditions  keep away from this Takes good pictures in daylight  but one has to work hard to get a non shaken picture in poor light conditions Battery life is about average  The good part is that it runs on regular AA batteries  so you can get them anywhere  But  the bad part is that you have to carry lots of them with you when you go on a trip  I am not sure if this has a charger inside  but the camera did not come with any AC adapter  There is a  DC in  socket on the camera  which means there would be an optional AC adapter from KODAK to use with this camera for an extra price  but I am not sure if that can charge the batteries  if we use rechargeable AA batteries The size of the camera is big for its features  Come on  Kodak designers  what were you thinking  Digital cameras don t need a film compartment  a motor to advance rewind the film  All they need is circuitry to record data onto a memory card  an LCD screen  and a flash and that s it  The size could be much smaller on this  With the camera being light weight and big in size  you get a plastic hollow feeling when you carry this camera  Even with this big size of the camera  the battery compartment is very tight  It is barely bigger than the size of the batteries  As a result  the tension on the spring is very high causing an overload on the small plastic cover that holds the batteries  My battery compartment broke with first month of its use  I now use duck tape to cover my compartment  I am not alone in this area  My brother who has the same camera has broken battery compartment too Camera features are very well decided in the design  Cut down all the non sense and give only required to an average user  Can take pictures in two different resolution settings on to in built memory or to an external compact flash memory  I used an 64MB external memory to take more than 300 pictures during one of my vacation on this camera  It takes little while to record the picture after you release the shutter  But I think it has more to do with the speed of the memory than the camera itself  I used a cheaper memory and hence it might be of less speed  It has an in built flash  not very powerful but of average power The interface software which downloads the pictures into your PC was simple to use and easy to understand  It has some bugs though  In my Windows XP  I cannot download to the same folder all the time  I have to let it create a new folder everytime I download pictures I would have liked a USB interface or a firewire interface  Serial port is too slow  I had to wait for considerable amount of time  before the pictures are downloaded to my PC It does not an optical zoom  eliminating the need of a motor here and another question on why that big size  It has a video out  cable has to be purchased extra  to connect to a VCR and record the video no audio I would only recommend this if you want a digital camera for a bargain price  
Camera, First of all i just have to say Before purchasing this wonderful camera  i read the reviews that people posted on this page  I wanted to see what was the overall opinion of this camera  Many have complained saying that is gives them problems  but after reading what the problems were  i had realized that it wasnt the actual camera  but other things that had caused the problems I bought the camera  and i must say i have never been more pleased  I used to own am AGFA CL30 Clik  and wasn t pleased at all  so that is why i decided a change  The main reason i need a digital camera is because i take pictures for a website  Mainly  the pictures are of parties  in the dark  during the night  I needed a camera that takes great quality pictures  even in the night time  The PDR M60 was exactly what i was looking for  I read reviews where people have complained that the camera has a  low flash  which is completely untrue  This camera has different flash settings  including a night feature  which takes bright and clear pictures even in LOW light  Another great thing that i have noticed is that you can take black and white pictures  This makes it more fun and interesting to explore the different picture styles  I already took a B W photo of my puppy  and let me tell you its the cutest picture ever The camera itself is pretty small  Its easy to hold  and comes with a neck strap  I wish it had came with an AC adapter  but those can be purchased for like  12 at RadioShack so its not a problem I have seen that many have complained about the USB cable and said that it doesnt work  Mine works just fine  I just think something is wrong with those peoples  USB Ports on their computer  and that is why they have problems with it  I have already transfered many pics onto my computer and the USB cable works just fine  Pictures get transfered very quickly too The camera should have a soft case just to protect the LCD  the is probably the only complaint i have other than the AC adapter  I bought a 64MB smartmedia card for  33 00 online  so i didnt really mind the fact that the camera came with a 4MB card I have a NiHM rechargable battery pack that i have used from my other camera  and i suggest using something like that just so you can have enough battery  I take pictures all night long at parties  and i need enough battery to handle the all night usage I really recommend this camera  you wont be disappointed  after you have it for a while  make sure you play around with the different settings that it has to be sure that it works the way you want it  This camera can also be UPGRADED  You just go online and upgrade it yourself  I am glad i had purchased it  and for the price i got it for  i think it was MORE than worth it  
Camera, So you think that you want to buy a digital camera  Well have I got news for you  These things are not at all as easy as they look  I thought that all I would have to do is buy one of these cameras and take some pictures and in a dew minutes I would have pictures to send everyone through email  That is not at all the case I went out and bought myself a nice digital camera that was not a lot of money but yet cost a pretty good penny  When I got home I sat down and read the manual that was only about four hundred pages long and only took me all day to read  Then I thought that I had it but this was only the start  Once I took a picture which only took me about an hour to figure out how to do I tried to down load it to my computer  This was one of the hardest things I have ever tried to do which is probably because I am not too good on the computer any ways  After awhile I finally figured it all out I think that this probably is one of the best digital cameras because it has a great picture that comes out and is very clear  I guess that I made a good choice when I bought this camera for my needs but feel that I should have just kept my money If I had to tell a friend if they should buy a digital camera I think I would have to have them over and try to use mine and see if they would be able to handle one br br  
Auto,  Hi  This is Ron Ravetti the internet manager at Big Valley Ford  I have read your synopsis  It sure appears you have done quite a bit of research on the supercrew  True  it is quite a unique vehicle  However  as to Saturn s new SUV coming out I remain quite sure they will not hold a candle to the supercrew  rather it will compete with our Escape  When properly equipped the Escape will tow 3500lbs  I believe the Escape to be a well needed vehicle to the SUV line up  at a good price  Have you checked one out  Wish to  Please feel free to contact me   One more thing  Big Valley has formed a  business Direct  dept to better facilitate your effort to enjoy a hassle free  relaxed buying experience with priority pricing b  You can see our  team   3 of us  in our ad contained in today s asparagus fest insert within the Record  pictures and all  Or  read yet another mention of this new department in the 4 13 auto section  Again  thank you for your comments  Ron Ravetti internet mgr business direct dept Big Valley Ford  Dear Mr  Ravetti I don t consider being badgered by four different salespeople after informing three of them that we are being helped by the first salesperson that approached us hassle free and relaxing  In fact we were so relaxed that we walked off of your lot with out purchasing  Maybe your hassle free buying experience could use a bit of adjustment Thank you for your letter and yes I did do a good job researching the Super crew  By the time I write a review I have known the vehicle very intimately When salespeople work on commission a bit of ethics is very important  No sale s lot I have ever been on ignored sales ethics on commission sales  Your sales people need to respect when told  we already are working with a sales person but thank you anyway  We were hassled right off the lot Follow up letter from Mr  Ravetti George handles most of my personal correspondence   George  Thanks for your reply  What I meant by hassle free is dealing with this specific department  business direct internet dept  your experience would be different  My team  3 of us  do not work the lot  Rather we are the fleet dept selling to internet prospects  personal referrals and business  Business direct is the new word for fleet  We do business different  Hector is truly a gentleman  On behalf of Big Valley Ford please accept our apologies for the treatment you received here  We strive to help each and every visitor  forgive us if we were a bit overbearing  In the event you wish to obtain numbers on a vehicle without coming in  please visit our site to determine if the unit you desire is in stock  let me know and I ll provide the numbers  Naturally  Hector will be on the deal  Ron Ravetti  Mr Ravetti  where do most of your sales home from  Wouldn t it be a bit wiser to properly train the sales people that have first contact with your customers A bit of a different beginning to a review but I thought the response to my last review was rather interesting  We had not received a hassle free buying experience at the Ford lot at the Stockton Auto mall in Stockton California  in fact it is was the worst experience we had ever had  When we first arrived at the Ford lot a sales person approached us by the name of Hector  Hector answered all the questions we needed answering  We informed him when we needed him we would find him and to let us be while we were looking and comparing  He was very polite and agreed to let us alone for a while  While we were looking at different vehicles at least three other salespeople approached  We informed each and everyone that we already had a salesperson  I can see the competition between salespeople and why they approached us  But I can t see why they couldn t respect a thank you and leave it at that  At least I am glad they appreciate Hector  the only polite helpful salesperson we found on the lot  Enough of this let us get on with the review 2001 Ford Windstar Limited Edition I think this would be a Van I would feel comfortable having my family in  The Windstar has many safety features such as a sensor system that provides the proper level of inflation for the dual stage driver and passenger airbags  The limited edition Windstar has side impact airbags for both the passenger and driver  These sensors determine just how much energy should be used to deploy the airbags according to the severity of the accident  Another standard safety feature is the ABS tire warning system that alerts when the tire pressure is low  One of the optional features is the all speed Traction Control that helps maintain traction on slippery roads  How about the Power Heated Signal Mirrors that contain a lighted arrow that alerts traffic behind to you lane changes  These also flash when the sliding door is open  People behind you know that someone is leaving the vehicle  The first I have ever seen is a conversation mirror that is on the overhead console that allows you to see the kids in the back seat with out your attention leaving the road  Foot pedals that move  I guess one auto dealer realized were not all the same height  The brake and accelerator pedals move  the driver can position them at their own comfort level  Wouldn t that be nice not having to move the seats each time another driver takes over  Maybe the best safety feature is the lower anchors and tethers for children  LATCH The 2000 Windstar achieved a five star government front crash test rating for the driver and front passenger Ok what did I really love about this van  The entertainment system in the back seat  If that had been available when I had young children think of the gray hairs that would have never turned gray  Pop in a video and the kids aren t nit picking each other  Just  WOW   Auto Vision Family Entertainment System  headliner mounted adjustable 6 4  color monitor removable video cassette player  stereo auido through vehicle speakers  two 12v powerpoints  2 headphones with 8  cords  infared remote control  sidepocket storage for video cassettes  rear seat control module with volume control  media selection  seek function  two headphone jacks that are compatible with popular video game systems i  Cost for this wonderful piece of mind   995 00 Just imagine the last two hundred miles of a long journey  The kids are tired  Pop in their favorite video game and they will be happy for the last two hundred miles  The drive can put a soothing CD in and enjoy the remainder of the trip  The Windstar has an AM FM stereo and a 6 disc in dash CD changer with a clock My hot cup of fresh coffee will sit perfectly safe in the self adjustable cup holders  Now I am forever chasing my hot cup of coffee across the dashboard and also catching it frequently on quick take offs The base price of this very useful and versatile vehicle is  33 570 adding the Auto Vision Family Entertainment System an additional  995 00 making the total price  35 220  The gas mileage is 18 in town and 24 highway  The fuel tank holds 26 gallons of fuel The Windstar has 3 8L SPI V6 engine and the 4 speed automatic transmission  On the highway there was plenty of power for passing  The front has a stabilizer bar and MacPherson Strut front suspension  There is a Twist Bean rear suspension  For a van it rolled into the turns nicely  The Windstar had a solid feel to it The Windstar was very easy for me to get up into  In fact of all the cars  trucks and vans we looked at that day the Windstar were the easiest  I loved the side door  It opened so easily  It had a power slide door  It closed with just a touch of a finger  I remember so many times with my Dodge Caravan having an armful of stuff trying to get the darn door open  The power door is sensational  The limited edition Windstar had 215 65r16 BSW SELF SEALING tires and a full sized spare tire  The self sealing tires are a pretty neat feature  I remember playing with one of these at a tire shop one time  They had a board with 3 nails on it that levered into the tire  Each time the puncture would seal immediately  I offended wondered how many punctures that tire ended up with when it was taken down as a demonstration and if it still held air This van will hold 7 people and still has plenty of additional storage space  The model we tried had bucket seats in the first and second row and a bench seat in the third row  The limited addition has many interior and exterior accents that sets off this vehicle rather nicely  To top all this off it has a keyless entry with a keypad The Windstar comes standard with a class II towing package and a 2 000 3 500 lbs  towing capacity  I believe this to be plenty adequate to tow a medium size boat  Though I am a bit leery about the V6 engine and if it would have enough power to tow a medium size boat  I would just hate it if I were the person slowing down a long line of traffic on a mountain pass  It sure does aggravate me when I m at the back of a slow line  The Limited Edition Windstar we are considering is a black with clear coat and mineral gray two tones  The 10 spoke brushed aluminum wheels set it off very nicely  The Ford no deductible bumper to bumper 3 year or 36 000 mile warranty is accompnied with the 24 hour emergency roadside assistance program  I would have liked an option of a V8 engine  I really don t think the V6 will do everything we will require it to do  I like the functionality of the Windstar  I especially like all the safety features  I always compare vehicles and their safety features by thinking to myself  would I use this automobile to bring a new baby home from the hospital  In the Limited Edition Windstar I think I would be comfortable bringing a new baby home  I love the open road  I get very anxious after just a short period of time of not being on the open road  Just set the wind behind me and I could go forever  That s exactly what I intend to do someday  is travel and see everything I can see until I finally get tired of going  
Camera, I m guessing you ve read a few other reviews already  and are no doubt familiar with the features and specs of this camera  so we ll deal with living with it  I originally purchased this camera around fifteen months ago as a gift for my wife  as she had taken a shine to my 1 3Mp Olympus D 150  While this camera was larger  it offered 2 1Mp resolution  and more  non menu  controlled features  She loved this camera  and it gave birth to an interest in photography  which I have encouraged  and nourished by trading her up to a Canon G2 this Christmas  While I inherited the A20  and our daughter now has the D 150  In general photography  the results from this camera are more than adequate to satisfy the average amateur user  and only the limitations of it s available features prevent the more artistic use of an enthusiast  However  I must qualify this by stating that we do use powerful photo editing software at home  and can correct exposure problems  color casts  or composure prior to printing  This means that we can operate to a wider tolerance than some  If you intend to just use the shots  as is  you may  depending on your personal tastes  find the results mildly over exposed  around 1 2 stop  but this can be adjusted on the camera to suit yourself  Never having used the software supplied with the camera  I can t comment on it  I use a digital camera primarily for work  I am an electrical engineer for a machine manufacturer  and am required to carry out field work to prove new designs  investigate possible design issues  and commissionings of modified proven products  This gives me a requirement for taking  technical photography  shots to expound upon what I have observed in the field  Frequently these shots are taken internally to machinery  and under very poor lighting conditions  I frequently use the  Macro  mode  and some are even taken  blind  with the camera at arms length Even under these circumstances I can normally produce the evidence I need quickly and easily  At home  we use a card reader to download the images  and having done so since we ve had the camera  no one seem to know where it s cabling is now  So  when I recently had to produce some images quickly at work for a briefing a lack of proprietry cord let me down  Had it been a standard USB  like Olympus cameras  This would not have happened  I have since purchased a PC Card adaptor for the CF card  so I can now load the images directly into my laptop  Personally  I find the menu options less easy to use than the Olympus version  but my wife views things the other way round  so I guess this is just a matter of personal taste and familiarity  Like most digital cameras  especially when using the screen a lot  battery life was poor  then my friend told me about  photolife   Energizer E  photo lithium  batteries  These are around twice the price of standard alkalines  but are designed for this use  and last fantastically well  I find myself changing batteries around every two months now  rather than about weekly as it was before  So now I have no complaints there  Also  the supplied memory card is hopelessly inadequate  and was quickly replaced by a 64Mb unit  As I only shoot with the minimum compression possible  this at least allows me to take a reasonable number of shots  65  as opposed to 7  as supplied  Fortunately these are now reasonably priced  but when thinking of buying  factor in the price of additional memory In summary  much as though I hate to let the camera do the thinking for me  the nature of my usage requires it to be so  This camera has never let either my wife  or myself  down  continually producing results within the limits we operate with easily  
Auto, I bought this car in Feb 2000 used  with 15 000 miles on it  I needed a good reliable car for commuting  with excellent gas mileage  I did my homework  and finally decided on the Neon  I ended up getting the Plymouth Neon  but it s identical to the Dodge Neon  I went for the 2 door since it s just me and my wife  and I liked the look of the 2 door  as well as the ability to open them up and be able to put large objects in the car  I ve moved a desk and a 6 foot high cat tree to day  takes some work  but it ll fit I haven t had a problem so far  2 years later and 30 000 miles  I regularly chain the oil  I had the brakes done once  and the tires replaced  but otherwise nothing  No mechanical problems what so ever  I ve been really impressed  And the car drives as well now as it did back at 15 000 miles  I ve read on a few Dodge Neon enthusiast sites that the car can start having problems around 60K  but alot of that has to do with how you drive it and care for it  I ve also talked to people with over 100K on their car with no problems  so take that for what it is worth Right off the gas mileage is awesome  Since I live in Los Angeles and commute about 60 miles round trip each day  I wanted something easy on gas  This car has been excellent  Whenever I talk to others about gas mileage I always seem to get the best  The flip side of course is that the car is only a 4 cylinder  and doesn t accelerate as quick as I would like  but it s a trade off worth having  The interior is great  The back is a little less spacious  but again this doesn t affect me  The front is great  all controls are easy to use and clealy marked  The drink holders dont really work for larger beverages  but anything like a Starbucks Venti or smaller is fine  The back seats fold down  giving you access to the trunk from inside  There s not much more I can say  I could go into every detail  but your best bet is to go test ride one yourself  Why cheat yourself when you can treat yourself  For the price  it s definately an amazing car  and I would buy another Neon once mine gets high in miles  
Auto, When I first got this car it was a wedding gift from my husband and it was a shock to me   Of course I was in love with this car when he first brough it home to me because it was my first new car   I was driving a 1996 Nissan Maxima which I loved and had 140K   miles on it and still ran like it was brand new   But once I got the Impalla Ls and started driving it the first month it was great then I started having trouble with it   Started out with small things and started getting larger  Listed are dates and reasons that I had this car in the shop  Please note I got this car in August of 1999  August 1999   Drivers side electric window switch went out October 1999   Had a new paint job on hood   top and trunk of car due to paint chipping off down to the metal and had new drivers side mirror put in because it could not hold up to the cold weather and cracked to pieces November 1999   Sear warmer shorted outand caused motor to go out and new seat had to be put in because you cannot replace just the motor on the seat warmer you have to put in a new seat March 2000   Seat warmer went out again   this time they just had to replace a wire  Ciggerette lighter stoped working  console would not shut and plastic part under shifter broke in half when putting car in gear and the gear assembly for the power steering went out  May 2000   Engine light stays on   had no power what so ever   Cradle bolts came loose  June 2000   Power Steering Rack once again came loose NOw let me elaborate on some of the problems and explain them a little furter   In October of 1999 I had to have the cars hood   top and trunk re painted because for some reason the paint starting just chipping off when you washed it or just rubbed it and it was down to the metal on the car  we took it into the dealer and of course they did not want to paint it and said that we got something on it   but my husband being the type of person he is that does not like to be accused of something that he did not do   fought with them about it and finally the man said bring it back on this day and the reginal manager will be here to make a decision about the car  so we went up there on that day and the man never showed up so they had to paint our car  They told us it would be about 5 days   and gave us a rent car well 5 days turned into one month   and then when I got the car back whoever buffed it out scratched the sides of the doors all up from the buttons on there jeans  So I had to once again take it back and have more work done on it to get those out   They never would tell us why the paint did that   So we got no explanation for that  As far as the seat warmers going out like they have and being repaired as many times as you can see above still to this day do not work   we just got fed up with them not being able to solve a simple problem like a seat warmer shorting out and gave up  The driver side works but the passenger seat does not work  The lighter would shoot sparks out when tryed to use  they said that it had a short in it and replaced it   The plate that is under the gear shift cracked in half when I put the car in gear   why I don t knwo they never would tell me   all they said is it got hung on something underneath and cracked it   They never want to tell you WHY something happened to your car when they know why  Then I started having problems with the car front end popping when the brake was applied   Well I only wrote down two times above that I took it to the shop but I took it more than that I just did not have the reciepts to actually see when I took it in   Anyways   we took it to several places and they all said it was different things so naturally each time we took it to a new dealer they NEVER fixed it   Finally we took our chances and took it back to once last dealer in Richardson Texas that has outstanding ratings for fixing cars   and to our amazement they fixed it and even drove it around for 15 mintues to make sure it was fixed bfore they called us to come get it   and mind you this was the manager that did this to ensure we would not have the problem with them not fixing it as we did with everyone else  And last but not least I will describe things that I dont like about this car and things that I do like   First I dont like this car because it rides rough most of the time but it does have good days   and the least little bit of wind catches underneath and will whip you right off the road if you are not careful   The original tires that came on the car really were terrible   But I love this car because its roomy   sleak   had a great radio   the air works great and heater as well   The seats feel great when driving and sitting they seem to make you feel like can just slide right in with no problems and drive hundreds of miles without being uncomfortable  I like the fact that the seats come down in the back so that you have access to your trunk because this car has a HUGE trunk and its very deep and when something falls to the back you cannot reach it fron the outside of the car you have to pull down the seats to get to it   All the mirrors seem to be put in the right places and hights for shorter people like me   The fact that the seats can adjust to hight not just up and back is great  Now that all the problems have been fixed in this car its great   I have not had any problems out of it since the last car dealer fixed it   I also got my car when they first came out   so I expected there to be problems with it being FRESH on the market   
Camera, I am not a professional photographer  Not even an amateur  expert  But I do know a quality camera when I see one  Much detail has been written about the S30 in all the other reviews so I won t waste your time repeating it  But I will give you my impression of this little beauty I have owned many cameras in my day  From Brownies to Leica s  I count 30  cameras owned over the years  I m not exactly young  I ve had pre war German cameras with great lenses  SLR s from most of the major Japanese Manufacturers  and smaller cameras the past 20 years  because the quality of their pictures had improved enough to make it desirable to use a more portable device to take photographs  I went to a seminar some years ago that had digital photography as its subject  I decided the product was nowhere near film quality and rejected the technology as premature  Well  it snuck up on me while I wasn t looking  When the density of the picture reached 3 4 or 5MP the digital age had arrived Several months ago I decided to buy a digital camera  I required that it take as good a picture as my 35MM Minox and Olympus  two rangefinder cameras that have given me great service  It had to be small enough to be able to be carried in a pocket  It had to have an excellent  auto  ability as well as a significant ability to adjust settings  It also had to be affordable  After reading all the reviews  and seeing the cameras in the stores  I initially focused on the Olympus C50  5MP and relatively pricey  The Olympus C4000  4MP and not very portable  and the Olympus D550  3MP  minimal adjusting ability and mixed reviews  I kept deferring my decision to buy  When sale prices started settling down I found that the Canon S30 was pricing itself near the C4000  and it had a Li Ion battery and charger included to boot  The more I thought about the S30  the better it looked  It is small enough to pocket yet not too small to handle  It has an excellent lens  The metal body is very durable  and beautiful  Also  Canon provides a great tutorial on its web site as well as updates for software and camera firmware  The cost  A major electronics discount store  probably having a slow week  met some internet prices I showed them   Bought it for  350 00  new and unopened But I haven t told you how I feel about this product  It s a jewel  The feel of it  The look of it  The sound of it  And it works better than I ever expected  A 16MB Compact Flash Card is not enough only because once the camera is in your hands you must take pictures  No problem  64MB costs about  20 00 now and you can reuse it 1 000 000 times  they say  The battery recharges in about an hour and even the charger is an elegant little device It s not usual for me to get emotional over an inanimate object  Last time was over a Mooney 201  small aircraft  If you choose this one you may just get hooked  March Update  On EBAY  I purchased 64MB of Compact Flash memory for  21 00    3 00 s h  from BRANDENBURKHART  I also purchased an NB 2L battery for  12 00    5 95 s h  from EFORCETRADING  THEY BOTH WORK PERFECTLY  
Auto, I picked up my brand spankin new F350 XLT LongBox SuperCab SRW PowerStroke 4x4 about 3 weeks ago and I ve got nothing but good things to say about it The diesel engine is fantastic for towing  I use this truck to pull my Land Rover around on a flatbed and I can climb grades like there s nothing back there  This motor also gets pretty good mileage  though not as good as I d hoped  I ve been seeing about 15 18 MPG depending upon conditions The downside to the diesel is that it s a gt  more expensive to buy  and b gt  really loud  My I don t think my neighbors like the fact that it sounds like I m firing up a Freightliner every morning when I leave for work The interior is spacious and comfortable  If you don t slide the front seats all the way back  there s room in the half sized rear area for real people  not the midgets they usually have in mind when they re desiging extended cabs  I had a friend back there for an 8 hour drive and she didn t complain at all about it  actually  she got the sweet deal because she could lie down  but whatever I have to sand bag the bed when I m not carrying a load because the springs are pretty stiff when it s empty  Not a big deal  but certainly something to be aware of  I went with the one ton because I figured that someday I might carry a cab over camper  If you don t need the load carrying ability  I d definitely go with the 250 I ve got the heavy service suspension  and you really do need to get running boards with this sucker  I don t have them yet  and it s a chore for me to climb into this truck  I m 6 2 quot  My mother  5 6 quot  finds it nearly impossible to get in This is a really expensive vehicle when you get the diesel and a reasonable compliment of options  By the time I was out the door  I d paid about  38 000 Complaints When the center front seat back is down  acting as a center console  anything you put under it on the seat will slide back and fall off the seat onto the floor behind  This means there s really no good place to put things like cell phones where they can be heard  and readily accessed  I ve got to come up with a solution for this one I got a bunch of slushy  gravely snow splashed on the side of the vehicle  and when I later went to roll down the window  the sand got between the seal and the glass and scratched it all to hell  You d think they could build a seal that actually kept the sand out lt b gt br br  
Auto, I bought a 2002 Eclipse because I had a 1992 V4 RS that I had to get rid of due to the birth of my daughter  Now that she no longer requires attention while I m having to manually shift gears  I have me another one  I found the V6 GT to be A LOT tighter than the 1992 I had  My husband and I recently went on an 1 100 mile trip in the car to far West Texas  We found ourselves repeatedly dodging deer  raccoons  jackrabbits  lizards and any other critter that happened on the road  The Eclipse hugged the curves  stayed on the road and responded quickly and this was at speeds of 80 90 miles per hour  It is also quite a bit quieter with very little road noise or engine noise  The clutch and gear shift is soft and quick  I don t have any problems with grinding  while shifting  when I skip a gear  The sound system is nice  My daughters car seat fits nicely in the back and I don t have problems getting her out  I can fit more stuff in my Eclipse than I can in my Stratus  I would recommend this car for a responsible  mature driver  I would not recommend it for a teenager  The car will flat get away from you given the chance  
Camera, Well  the first opinion will tell ALL of the features of this camera  So I will talk a bit about the image quality and make a few comparative statements The very first thing I noticed when I pulled this camera out of the box  is that it is the sharpest looking camera I have ever seen  So if looks are important to you then check this baby out I printed out a 8 5 x 11 inch print on a dye sub printer and compared it to a similar print done from the Fuji 4700  The 4700 had excellent close up detail  but small text in the background  though legible  was not sharp  The 6800 had even better close up detail  and I could clearly read ALL of the small text  license plates  in the background  There was a whole lot less pixelization in the 6800  Color reproduction was also very accurate  The colors in my print were just about dead on without any manipulation at all Now we can talk a bit about zooming ratios  With digital cameras  resolution has a HUGE part to play in the zooming capability of the camera  The higher the resolution  the more detail you will see  and therefore the more you can magnify the image  This is basically the same concept as using finer grain films to get a bigger enlargement  You can magnify a 100 ASA film much more than you can an 800 ASA film  Likewise you can magnify a 6 Megapixel image more than you can a 1 Megapixel image  So the point I am getting to is this  the effective zooming ability of one camera can be compared to the effective zooming ability of another camera by multiplying the resolution by the optical zoom and then simply seeing which one comes out with the bigger number  For instance  you have a 1 MP camera with a 3x optical zoom  1 times 3 is 3  Then you have a 3 MP camera with a 3x optical zoom  3 times 3 is 9  So the 3 MP camera has 3 times the effective optical zooming ability of the other camera  So now you can do the math on the 6800 yourself and compare the zoom to any other camera out there The math above may easily be confused with Digital Zoom  However  they are NOT the same thing  The above formula is simply a way of linking the actual enlarging capacity of the image to the telephoto capacity of the lens  Digital zoom has NOTHING to do with the lens on the camera In fact  I would say that digital zoom should not even be taken into consideration when buying a digital camera  Your computer can do the digital zooming after you transfer the image onto your hard drive  And the computer can do it faster and to the exact area you want it to  AND it won t eat your precious battery power By the by  the 6800 uses Fuji s NP 80 battery  Which means excellent battery life and the ability to charge the battery without removing it from the camera  
Auto, The body of this car hasn t fallen apart while I am driving by a mere miracle  he a c vent have fallen off  the arm rest is broken  the window seals and door seals have un glued themselves from the car  it s all a mess you would think its a 1980 by the looks of the falling body parts it be good to use this car is scary movies The transmission was just replaced an the fuel tank was replaced  let me see whatelse  the brakes have been replaced and rotars over 4 times within a 3 year range and get this the car only has 46 000 miles  why so little mileage  wellllets see it has probably spent 60  of it s life with me at the dealer and not drivable because of the continous engine problems  the engine light comes on  the oeverdrive light turns on  it chokes and it has been towed about 20 times that Geico told me  one more to and I will loose my towing privilages for that car  welll it isn t my fault  the car has left me stranded whatelse am I to do  jsut avoid all KIAS please  
Auto, You may have read my initial review of the 2001 Focus ZX3 where I lauded the car s impressive features for the price  impressive handling  styling and comfort  To say I am  dissappointed  Six months and 7 000 miles into my ownership experience  is a gross understatement This vehicle has spent 16 days in the shop because of a variety of fuel system and transmission problems   5spd manual  The dealership initially insisted that there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that they could not duplicate my complaint  After doing exhaustive internet research  I found that the transmission problem affects ALMOST EVERY Focus with the 5 speed manual  I also found that although Ford initially denied there was any such problem  the company has recently issued a service bulletin regarding  gear rollover noise Gear rollover causes a distinct chattering from the transmission  The car sounds like an old diesel engine  There is no doubt that the noise will substantially impair the trade or resale value of this car and it suggests that a more serious transmission problem is yet to come  Ford says the noise is  normal  Gas consumption is MUCH less than Ford claims under all driving conditions The engine loses RPM and stumbles  as if it s going to stall  at almost every traffic light  My dealer has been unable to fix the stumble There is a noise coming form the cargo area which sounds like a mechanic left a wrench or something inside the body I am filing for the lemon law hearing this week  I highly suggest you run a word search in the USENET archives and check out the problems people are reporting with their Focus  
Auto, Styling  I have to say  in my opinion  I really don t like the styling of the Impala  It s traditional  generic  over styling typical for a General Motors vehicle  But obviously it doesn t offend those loyal to the blue bowtie mark because it is one of Chevrolet s best selling models Safety Safety Features  Standard are dual front airbags for both front passengers  a driver s side  side airbag is optional  I have no idea why Chevrolet offers a driver side only side airbag  other than they might be afraid that a child will be sitting in the passenger s front seat and the child could be leaning toward the airbag  increasing their chance of injury from it  However  other car companies have went around this by just installing a sensor in the seat that deactivates the airbag if someone is leaning in its path  Most likely its just typical GM bean counting  they didn t want to invest the time or the money in developing the seat sensor so they just didn t put a side airbag for the passenger in at all  Also  recently GM has deleted standard ABS on many of their models Safety Ratings  The Impala has done well on all its crash tests  It received a dual five star frontal crash test rating from the government  side impact tests were excellent as well  four stars for front and rear passengers  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety  IIHS  gave the Impala a  Good  rating in its frontal crash test Handling  There is a major difference in handling between the base model and the LS trim line  The base model has a marshmallow like suspension that does not promote good stability at highway speeds  The LS has a more aggressively tuned suspension  which is a bit firmer and it doesn t compromise the ride at all  The Impala does not come close to its competition at all in terms of handling  mainly the Accord and Passat  but  those stepping up from the Lumina will be more than happy Ride  Like many GM products in the past  both the base and LS model suspensions are overly soft  The base model is the worst  the ride on the highway is comfortable but leaves you wondering what would happen if you had to make an evasive maneuver at high speeds  The LS s ride is similar to that of the base models  only more controlled  If I had to swerve around an object at highway speeds  I wouldn t be worried about it at all in an Accord or a Passat  but I d be really worried how the base model Impala would handle this situation Build Quality  You would think that Chevrolet would catch on to the reason why Honda and Toyota are out selling them  Build quality is horrible  The dash has large gaps between panels  and the materials themselves aren t exactly of good quality  The leather on the seats is thin  shiny  and rather cheap feeling and so is the padding underneath them  The paint job wasn t bad  but the panel gaps were large compared to its competitors  One problem we ve had on our Impala is that we had to have the front doors re hung on their hinges because they began to sag so badly that we had to lift the door up slightly to close it so we wouldn t damage the car  The driver s side door is sounding like it needs to be re hung again at only 24 000 miles  the dealer tells us this is normal  and they have had to do it to many other Impalas Interior  As I have said in the  Build Quality  section  it leaves much to be desired as far as quality  Ergonomics are average and so are the seats  Roominess is one of the Impala s strengths  there is more than enough room for all passengers  The reflection of the sun from the dash is horrible  You would have thought they learned from the previous model that this is not safe and very distracting on sunny days  Audio  The sound quality coming from the speakers is horrid  Highs might as well be non existent  the midrange is lacking to say the least  The Bass   the worst and most annoying think about this sound system  seems OK at lower levels  but turn it up a little past normal and everything becomes muddy and distorted  Needless to say  I do not listen to the radio in this car Engines  There are two to choose from  a 3 4L V 6 or a 3 8L V 6  The first engine offers a meager 180 horsepower that moves the base model adequately  The LS trim line gives 200 more horsepower  which allows the Impala to compete much better with other cars in its class  Value  GM is trying to up the value with this car by offering 0  APR for sixty months  which may attract many looking to buy in this segment  However  I would choose the Accord  Camry  or Passat over this car any day Overall  The Impala is basic transportation  and there are cars that offer better quality and design for the same money  If your thinking of buying the Impala  make sure you drive the competition first  When the lease ends next year  we won t be sad to see this car go  
Auto, The 1999 Grand Cherokee  Codenamed the  quot WJ quot  to jeepheads  is the first redesign of the Grand Cherokee since it s introduction in 1993  The  quot ZJ quot  model Daimler Chrysler went all out on this machine  Hired Porsche to do the bodywork  you can tell it s MUCH more aerodynamic than the previous generation  particularly when they re parked side by side  the brand new V8 engine is more powerfull than the previous  and more fuel efficient too  not including the 1998 limited 5 9 liter model  though  the Interior is very nice  and the drivetrain  well  the drivetrain is what so many love and hate about the vehicle  The Drivetrain of a vehicle is it s heart and soul  it can make or break a car  You can have the worst interior  the worst ergonomics  but one heck of a drivetrain  and the car will be famous  and loved by many and desired by many more  Case in point  the Viper  You could also have a car with the Best interior  the most Luxurious appointments ever designed  but have a really poor drivetrain  and the car will Flop   Ok  so I can t think of any cases here  I guess if you spend that much money designing the interior  you ll hire someone competent to do the drivetrain too The Grand Cherokee s new drivetrain  is a Mixed Blessing  The Design of the Quadra Drive is nothing short of sheer brilliance  a 4 5 speed transmission  2 2nd gears  for upshifting and downshifting  Viscous differentials all the way around  so if 3 wheels completely lose traction  one will still have it  Despite what they may claim  no production AWD car has this capability  It s quite simply astounding  particularly in VERY poor roads or off road situations  its like having detroits or ARBs at your beck and call  sorry  jeep tech speak slipped in there The problem  is spotty quality  There are numerous complaints about the drivetrain failing  mostly due to poor quality control with the parts that make the Viscous Coupling differentials  or the transmission itself  I have heard numerous  quot Fixes quot  for these problems in all the message boards I ve hung around in  but there seems to be no sure fire bet  The funny thing about it  if you can call this funny  is that a Grand Cherokee will be complete heaven  or complete  other place  throughout it s life  Most  at least 90  of Grand Cherokee 99  owners have had 0 problems with the vehicle  and  judging from the past performance of grand cherokees  they never will  It s those 10  that get a faulty one  that have the problem  No matter what they do to try and fix it  the problems allways come back  every time  every case  Not only is this frustrating to the owner  but the Mechanics go absolutely Batty trying to figure out what s causing the problems to keep re appearing  I know some of the best mechanics in the US  that can completely change around a vehicle or build a brand new one from the ground up  with nothing more than simple paper sketches  and they have not been able to figure it out  Do cars have auras If you get a good one  you will absolutely fall in love with it head over heals  it is honestly that good  If you get a bad one  you will rue the day you decided to purchase one  and can t understand why so many people like them so much So  writing an Opinion on this vehicle is particularly tricky  On one hand  it is a marvel of engineering  and  if you get a good one  quite simply nothing will stand up to it in comparative testing  and it s just a joy to drive  on road or off  It s quiet as a caddy  the ride is smooth as silk  for an suv  the engine performance is superb  and even the gas milage is better than expected  the seats are comfy  etc  etc  etc If you get a bad one  well  ouch It eventually  to me  boils down to the ever burning question   quot Would I reccomend this vehicle to a friend quot  and the answer is I simply don t know  90  odds are fairly good  but would you  REALLY  put a friend into a position where there s a 10  chance that they could be bjorked And considering that the problems wouldn t make themselves clear untill after a few thousand miles at least  its not like they could be detected on the lot  so test driving one simply won t work If Chrysler s customer service was as good as it should be  and replace those vehicles that are faulty instead of trying to nitpick them to death or simply ignore the owners and hope they ll go away  I would reccomend one whole heartedly So  While this review will have a  quot Not reccomended to friends quot  on it  I still think it is a fine vehicle  and if you want to take the risk  go for it This review is probobly one of the hardest I ve ever written anywhere  since I am a hard core jeep guy  My cherokee has 260 000 miles on it  and I still love it  but I do place credit where credit is due  and I also put blame where blame is due  as well  If you have any doubts  I would wait untill the next model year  and see if DC has decided to seriously investigate these problems  Because untill they do  I have no choice but to avoid the vehicle that I want to buy when I retire br br  
Auto, I have owned a 1998 mitsubishi 3000 GT  base model  for a year  I purchased it brand new with all options including leather and infinity sound system at a great price  with the 100K extended warranty Basically this car should have never been made  Who puts a 160 HP v6 in a 3350 lbs car  It is very sluggish and slow off of the line  Although I found good acceleration  compared to an escort  in 3rd and 4th gears  At first suspension and handling seemed good but only if you are going straight  It takes corners at higher speeds poorly for a high performance sports car  Also  if you try to break around a corner  the breaks lock up  I have had this happen to me three times all leading to accidents  By the way Anti lock breaks are not even an option on the base model  My car didn t last long enough for me to test its engine reliability but many electrical parts had to be replaced within the first year The only thing going for this car is its looks Overall  I wouldn t even consider this a sports car  It has a Galant engine  and lack of antilock brakes in such a heavy car makes it extremely unsafe  It fits two people and maybe a duffle bag in the trunk  Don t even try to fit a small suitcase in the trunk or a passenger in back seat  unless they are Yoga masters they will not fit  even small children complain  I learned my lesson  if you want a 3000 GT buy the VR4  Now I know why they discontinued this model  It was one of the most unreliable and unsafe cars I have owned br br  
Camera, I m a little ashamed to admit  I was first attracted to this camera by it s looks   boxy   snub nose  brushed metal  retro look  Beautiful After doing a lot of research on this camera  and reading the excellent reviews here by  mbfd316  and  keithw 2000  I made the purchase decision In it s price range  I really don t think there is a better camera  Before this  I ve bought and used cameras by Olympus  three of them  Nikon  Coolpix  Sony  1st generation Mavica  and others  If you have Windows XP  setup is more automatic than you can imagine  Plug it in  XP finds it  identifies it as a  USB Storage  device  and installs drivers  You don t even need the supplied drivers  or software  Please make sure to click the  Remove Hardware  icon in your system tray and  stop  this  USB Device  before unplugging it  The world won t end if you forget this  but it sure won t hurt You are then given the choice of launching whatever image editing software is in your computer   begin editing  or simply launch Windows XP s explorer to drag   drop photos  For Windows 98se  you may be asked to insert the supplied CD  then click enter to let Windows find and install the driver  Some of the reviews I read around the internet on this camera complained of less than stellar performance in low light  I have found this to be at least as good as most or many digital cameras in this category  I even tested it under  no light  by putting it on a tripod at night and taking a photograph of a city skyline  The photograph was great  ALL point n shoot cameras are going to have some limitations in poorly lit  indoor settings  Any camera that attempts to use a tiny  built in flash will inevitably encounter limitations   particularly  digital  you just have to remember to keep your subjects WELL lit for indoor photos Testing this camera indoors with existing light   I ve found it to be passable  and no worse than what is  normal  in the Point and Shoot world Features     I ll begin by saying that this camera has some great ones  Most notably  the ability to adjust your ASA   ISO settings  There is also a  forced flash  or  fill flash  capability  as well as cancelling flash  and even a low light sync mode   which I tested in a night photo with great results  Adjustable white balance and manual adjustment to exposure compensation  from minus 1 5 to plus 1 5 in third step increments  is GREAT for a camera in this price range    Macro capability is outstanding here  I am amazed at how close  clear and sharp my extreme close ups are    Video Out  Having the Video Out capability means you can record your little clips and photographs to Video tape and send them to friends and relatives who don t even have a computer  Useability   This camera is EASY to use  in the automatic  point and shoot mode  Some will complain about the lens cap  just make sure you have it tethererd to the camera with the supplied cord  and you ll be alright Overall   I was amazed at the care with which this was packaged  It was definitely intended to be a quality offering and it is  The owner s manual is a BOOK  about an inch or two thick  and weighing nearly a pound  Detailed and informative BONUS   the Imaging Software supplied with this camera is  Image Expert  which you might also know as  After Shot  by the excellent people at JASC   the people who bring you  Paint Shop Pro  Consider this a  49 bonus  it is excellent software made specifically with digital cameras in mind I ve been printing up some OUTSTANDING 5 X 7 photographs of portraits  wild life and even night shots   a few 8 X 10  but that costs a lot of money in ink The Costco where I live has a processing station where you bring in your smart media card and insert it   select the photos you want printed  take your card back   then come back to pick up your printed photos a few days later  Just as if you d dropped off a roll of film  I tried this and am now HOOKED on it  What a fantastic benefit  and at only 24 cents per print My prints from the processsor were great  Maybe I just wasn t asking enough of the digital realm  but I ve gotten much more than I d expected with this camera  If you re considering the Fuji Finepix 2600 or the Canon Powershot A40  consider this one as well  I think this a near equal  and in some cases better camera  and a MUCH better value  
Camera, First   Do not buy this camera if you plan to use it under Linux   It does not conform to the USB specification  and will not work without you doing some kernel hacking That said  I m happy with the camera  I ve had it one month  and apart from two wasted days trying to get it to work on my system  I only run professional software  nothing from Redmond  it has performed flawlessly b My use for the camera   snapshots for sending to friends and family  Will probably never print  or maybe only rarely  No intention of using it for anything professional b Quick blurb about the USB drive mechanism   this is really nifty  It allows you to plug the camera into your computer s USB port  and the camera appears as a disk drive with JPEG images in a standard subdirectory  It was trivial to write a hotplug script which detects the camera being plugged in  mounts it  transfers all the pictures to local disk  deletes the pictures from the camera  and unmounts the camera with a suitable alert sound  No need for me to unlock my screen  I can just snap pictures  upload them  repeat  then look at the pictures later PROS  What I like about it b Excellent human factors   The Olympus engineers outdid themselves  All controls are simple  easy to find  even for a fumblefingers like me  and easy to use  The most frequently changed settings  flash  and macro mode  are accessible via hotkeys  without having to navigate menus  If you do have to use the menus  they are mostly clear  just two or three obscure icons b Excellent picture quality   Very sharp  clear pictures  Much better than I had hoped for  but bear in mind  I m a simpleton  and not as picky as some true digital photography mavens b The USB drive mechanism  mentioned above  No need for cumbersome clicky GUI nonsense or special software b Excellent Zoom and macro   The 3x optical zoom is fantastic  at least for this newbie unaccustomed to such fancy features  The macro operation takes very clear pictures b Lots more features  such as the LCD viewscreen  ability to expand way past the 8M card  long battery life  102 pictures so far  most with flash  and battery is still going strong  goodly 1280x960 resolution  But all of this information and more is available form the product literature  and you don t need to read about it here  Suffice it to say that I m happy with  all  the features CONS  The bad news b Does not conform to the USB specification   There s a checksum that s implemented incorrectly  Wintendoze doesn t check this value  unsurprisingly  which is why the camera works under that OS b Awkward lens cover   The lens cover slider is a little hard to open  especially when wearing gloves  It can also be jarred unintentionally when taking pictures  drawing the lens in  This just takes some getting used to In short  what a fantastic little camera  If only the Olympus firmware developers had been a little more professional about testing  I would be unhesitating in my glowing recommendation of this unit  As is  the fact that they blundered something so obvious makes me question what else they may have screwed up  
Camera, After 3 months of use  including quick shots in all kinds of lighting during the holidays  I now believe digital cameras can replace the 35mm SLR for most users  First to some concerns others have noted  You can save your desired settings as defaults for the next time you turn on the camera  see All Reset in the Mode Setup menu  While the LCD image of a picture tends to look over exposed at times  the pictures actually saved and viewed or printed have been excellent  Getting a SmartMedia Reader on my Win ME computer  images processed by Picture It  and printed via an HP ink jet have been no problems  8x10 s of a variety of 2 and 3 MB images have been impressive  The flash is not as good as an external unit on my SLR  but is still quite adequate for the typical inside family shots  Fill flash and long flash off exposures work well  The fast lens is invaluable  I had no problems with the remote control  Battery life has been very good  I use the LCD most of the time to get the image framed properly  The reassurance of AA s working in a pinch is nice  The 128MB non OEM Smart Media card works perfectly  I have found the menus and controls quite reasonable  Study the menu structure via the LCD  a button turns it on  and practice  I haven t found any meaningful errors in the manual  but some of the exposure compensation adjustments  with vs without flash  are not clear  Everyone would arrange the menu structure differently  I wish some adjustments were built into the mode dial and back buttons instead of where they are in the menus  I fastened the lens cap with the included strap and have trained myself to always take it off before turning the camera mode dial from OFF to P  on  since the lens extends  All in all these are minor learning experiences and issues for an excellent camera  
Camera, Let me preface this review by saying that I would never spend  900 on a camera  digital or otherwise  I don t have the money for that  My wife and I received this camera as a gift from her parents last Christmas   An extremely generous gift  you might say  Well  you are correct  In any event  we were pleasantly surprised to be given this camera  Let me explain the camera to you very briefly from a non professional photographer s point of view The Camera has a great shape to it  It s small and light and fits nicely into your hand  It is very aesthetically pleasing  It s silver surface and large zoom lens attract attention whenever i take it out  When turned on  there are 3 options Play  Still  and Movie  In Play mode you are able to view all of the pictures currently stored on your memory stick  You can do this by jogging through each picture 1 by 1 or by scrolling through an index  The pictures only take about 3 seconds to load on the screen  so patience is not required  In Still mode you are able to take still pictures  The features that the camera offers are so numerous that I wouldnt do them all justice  Besides  many of them are beyond my scope of need as a casual photographer  It is very simple to switch between color  B W  Sepia  and Negative effects using the on screen menu  The flash bulb pops up with the slide of a switch  When you press the little silver button to take a picture there is an audible  click  that you hear that lets you know you have taken a picture  In Movie mode  you are able to shoot MPEG movies  I have only used this feature once with mixed results  The Camera actually captured the sound well  as i was taping my wife singing  The video was not the best quality  but i m sure if i played with the settings i could get it to be better Let me recap the pros and cons with this camera for you PRO the camera looks great  is lightweight  and feels good and stable in your hands PRO For the first time user  the camera is easy to operate  just turn on  put in STILL mode  and press the shutter button PRO The USB cable  supplied with camera  has worked great for me  Pictures are uploaded to my computer at a rate of about 3 15 seconds per picture  depending on what resolution you have it set on PRO The highest resolution lets you take clear  crisp  8 5x11s  The lowest setting still gives you clear 3x5 s PRO The camera shuts itself off after 5 minutes of no use so you dont waste the battery PRO  The MGI Photosuite software that came with the camera has been very clutch for me  It works great and i use it a lot CON The price  This bad boy is gonna run you at least 900 bucks  If you got the money  then i by all means recommend it  If you re scrapped for cash  you might do better getting a  50 cheapy at Wal Mart  CON The Manual is alright  but i thought it could have been better written  There are alot of features that i havent explored with mine for fear of mining through the manual for the information CON No case  They include a brochure featuring a nice case you can buy for around 40 bucks  But after paying all that money for the camera  its like a small slap in the face CON The memory stick included is only 8MB  this didnt affect me because my in laws included a 32MB stick with our present that is more than adequate  I can take 50 pictures at a mid level resolution and still have space left  If i only had 8MB i would be annoyed CON  The battery does tend to run out pretty fast  but i like the meter which lets you accurately know how long you have left  If Sony would have included a second battery  they would have added a ton of value to this product CON  The flash is extremely bright  Maybe there s a setting where i can change that  but i havent found it yet  almost every pic i take with the flash makes the subjects look as if they have not been in sunlight for 2 3 years  I often take pictures w o it and then enhance the pictures and brighten them using the software supplied  
Camera, I am not  yet  an owner of an FD73  so it may seem odd that I m writing a recommendation for it  I sell stuff on eBay  and in order to have an image of my items  I bought a Kodak DC10 a few years ago  nice pix  but very limited in the zoom and closeup requirements  My friend  however  has a Sony FD73  and In helping him with lighting and backgrounds  I came to discover how useful the camera really is  and I borrow it frequently  The zoom range is 10 to 1  from wide angle to true telephoto  The lens focuses  very sharply too  to 1 2 inch from your subject  I ve taken pix of a coin in one frame  a large camera on the next  and shots of damage done to my neighbor s house on the following shots  without any changes or additional accessories  Itis also useful for taking pictures of valuable objects and collections  as well as general inventory of home furnishings  for insurance purposes  The pictures are very sharp and clear  but I recommend using an imaging program other than the one supplied with the camera for doing something more than  quot tweaking quot  or re sizing  Adobe  Microsoft  and a host of other software makers have good imaging applications  My personal choice is Micrografx Picture Publisher 8  The camera s fundamental drawback is the lack of higher resolution required to make decent prints  If you can be satisfied with prints measuring no more than 4x5 inches  you can be satisfied with the FD73  For web use  I have not seen a camera more suitable  Once you ve learned to accurately frame your picture within the camera  it is a simple task to put the disk in your  quot A quot  drive  send it to your web  or image hosting  site  and re name it there  Other photographers who contribute to Photo chat rooms  such as eBay s  seem to recommend it highly  too  Their general opinion is that the word  quot EBAY quot  should be inscribed on the camera body   
Auto, I was immediately intrigued with the Jaguar S type when I saw it at the auto show in Cleveland  My trepidation came from memories of pushing the products of British Leyland which in the end permanently damaged my back  No more English cars I promised myself However  the Austin Healy 3000 that did it to me  I think  is one of the best looking cars ever built  The S type was a nod in the same direction  with one difference   Ford  I couldn t imagine Ford owning a vehicle that craps out after driving through a puddle  So with trepidation  I bought a S type with the 4 0L V 8  After two years of drenching rain  hail  heat  dust  every type of weather thrown at it  this Jag has not only never failed  it has never faltered  I don t get to drive it much  because my wife has taken it over  but when I do drive it  it is a superb handler on the highway  This car is fun to drive   it is tight  fast and sure footed  And another dimension that I don t read about in other reviews is the turning radius   this car has the tightest turning radius of any car I have ever driven  The best is when I drop my wife off at church and pull into a short break in a line of parked cars where the church driveway is  other cars doing the same thing block the curb lane  I pull all the way in  allowing traffic to move in the curb lane  and when traffic clears  I don t have to back up to clear the parked car just ahead of the driveway  I pull right out Another remarkable feature is the navigation system  My wife had to make a number of residential deliveries into neighborhoods she was unfamiliar with  for political campaign purposes  She just programmed the addresses into the navigation system  and the navigation to each house was perfect  We have also successfully used the navigation system to find restaurants we are unfamiliar with   as a matter of fact we have come to depend upon it My trepidation is gone   this car is a real performer  fun to drive and when you get it out on the interstate on a long drive  it is like silk with nice growl  
Camera, When I purchased the DC 215 I was very skeptical about spending this kind of money on product I wasn t sure would really be worth it  Normally when something fairly new comes out  it is less than user friendly Well in the case of this camera I was very impressed  And I still am  I can normally fit 12  14 photos on one disk  Even though the thought of having to install a program on the computer just to download the images seemed like a bad idea  It actually made it easier to work with and to adjust the picture to exactly how I wanted to see it  The DC 215 is very easy to use and has many options  The good thing is there isn t so many options that you walk away from it with your head spinning  It has the sophisticated look  the complex look  Yet  very easy and fun  I think the ability to zoom and view on the LCD screen is my favorite part  It may be the simplest but none the less the part I like the most  This camera takes very good quality pictures  I have yet to take one that I didn t like  And if you don t want to keep one of the pictures you can simply delete that one from the disk and move on  If you can afford it BUY IT  It is a great and fun camera that will keep you taking pictures faster than you can say film developing br br  
Camera, I ve been watching the digital camera phenomenon for several years now  Last year I purchased a Kodak DC215 and was a bit disappointed  This year I bought the Nikon Coolpix800 for only a little more than what I paid for the DC215  and I am completely satisfied with it  This camera make sense both as a one size fits all solution for quality internet business and artistic use  and as a supplemental camera for a professional or serious amateur who needs a lightweight but still high quality tool for specific situations where the weight and bulk of professional equipment is not desired  The price performance ratio of digital photography finally came into clear focus for me with this well designed product  I had three different reasons for purchasing a digital camera 1  Quick image processing for the internet 2  Visual reference  quot notes quot  for artistic projects 3  Pure photography While the DC215 was  almost  acceptable for application  1  for  2 and  3 it was wholly inadequate  The Coolpix800 excels on all three fronts Plus  its sturdy construction and light weight make it perfect for long mountain bike rides  full day hikes  and tucking into my pocket when I go exploring uncharted territory  I can t imagine a better camera for these purposes  I don t even notice the weight  And it can take uncompressed TIFF images  The menus and controls are well designed  fairly intuitive to use  and mostly unobtrusive Now if I could just find a good low cost source for CompactFlash memory I am completely satisfied with this great product br br  
Camera, I finally decided to get a digital camera given that we are expecting a new child the next month or so  My wife called me crazy when she saw how much research I was doing  I knew nothing about these things  but quickly came up to speed  I knew I didn t want to spend more than  400 and wanted at least 2MP  After searching and searching  it came down to the Fuji 2800 and the Canon A40  I also considered the Fuji 2600 but decided that I liked the other body styles better   plus video with sound was nice   what is the point of video if you can t hear anything I bought both cameras and returned the Canon the next day  The image quality on the 2800 is much better from what I can tell  I took alot of indoor shots and the A40 pictures came out unfocused while the 2800 shots came out clear  While the A40 does have TV out  more manual options  better video quality  the 2800 image quality was what convinced me   after all  what are all the bells and whistles if the basic stuff doesn t even work well The EVF LCD definitely gets dim in any kind of low light  it doesn t have to be very dark   just a little less than normal indoor lighting will cause significant dimming   the A40 was better about this  but I kind of like the EVF  especially since I can see the menu outputs on it and it shows the entire picture The 2800 is basically a souped up entry level camera  There aren t many manual controls  but that s fine for my wife and I  Everything is set so you can just start shooting  Also  with Windows XP  it recognized the camera as a removeable drive easily and I didn t have to install any software  Transferring pictures in this manner is just like copy files from a floppy disk  Very easy I can t say much about the included software  but I m sure it s decent  The 16MB SmartMedia card that is included is not a bad deal   it can take about 40 normal 2MP pictures and about 20 fine 2MP pictures  Good for beginning  but I bought a 128MB card  The included alkaline batteries are also okay  but as most suggest  I bought NiMH from Thomas Distributing By the way  I got a great deal  I think    Microcenter is having a 20  sale on all digital cameras through June 2  So I went to Circuit City  in NH   no sales tax  and price matched  110  price match  to the Microcenter sale  Originally 379 99   I got it for 294 99  Makes me feel a whole lot better too  I got the 128MB card from Amazon for  60 and 8 NiMH  1800 mAH  including charger for another  50 or so  I still have yet to find a good camera case for it since the body is somewhat awkward  I m also considering buying a slave flash to help with indoor lighting  All in all  I came in right around what I had budgeted in all and I am very satisfied  
Camera, I ve been wanting a digital camera for almost three years  since the days of  high resolution 640x480  pictures  but would never take the plunge because the technology was not  right  yet  The Canon G1 made me change my mind and am I pleased I bought it To make easier to read the review  I ll separate it into topics 1  IMAGE QUALITY That s the most important thing for me  and any top 3 3 MPixel camera will get you a very good picture  It is still less than half the quality of 35mm pictures taken with a good SLR camera  which tops at about 8 MPixels  but if you are gonna used it digitally  the scanning process would probably even things out  That said  a  800 dollar digital camera can already take on a  200 SLR 2  FEATURES Here is where this camera shines  It is the only one that has a ISO 50 mode  that produces great pictures  As with any other camera  using it at 400 ISO produces images with extreme noise  so you will want to go up to 100 or maybe ISO 200  But being able to view in real time the effect of aperture and shutter speed compensates for it in a sense The battery is fantastic  and you can take more than 500 pictures without having to recharge it  I don t even think a spare is necessary  unless you will be in the wild for some time And there s still the RAW format  a lossless format  a la TIFF  that occupies 1 3 of the space an uncompressed TIFF does  Very useful  for you can set up white point  contrast  sharpness and saturation without losing any image quality  If you are taking critical pictures  this is a gift from heaven For comparisons with other cameras  check out this cool site  www dpreview com 3  CAPACITY Oh boy  if you are going to buy this camera  do yourself a favor and buy the IBM Microdrive  What about taking 130 pictures in RAW or 160 in JPEG  maximum quality  without having to upload them to your PC  Yes  being able to use the microdrive was the deciding factor for me to buy this camera  And that s for the 340MB microdrive  but it is also available in 512MB and 1GB  You do the math 4  ADD ONS What I really would like is to be able to use SLR lenses with digital cameras  but that s not possible with the G1  in truth it s not possible with any camera in this price range You can buy a macro lenses  x 8  or zoom  x1 2  however it is really not worth the money  It is too little for too much 5  CONCLUSION I have some gripes about it  the most severe being the auto focus feature  a pain to use  a lot less precise than the Canon 1000FN SLR I have  and the pain that is using manual mode with flash and the LCD not compensating for it  so turning black at a high shutter speed aperture combination But take my word  this is a great machine  that will not only amaze your friends  it has happened with me all the time  mostly in parties  but also amaze you with it s features  image quality  battery life and capacity with an added microdrive In other words  if you are willing to spend  800 in a digital camera  go for a Canon G1  If you are willing to spend  1050  buy the G1 and a microdrive  You won t regret it br br  
Camera, I purchased this digital camera  because I am very bad at developing film  I currently have about 20 rolls laying around my house  waiting to be developed  Some are from when I was in the Army in 1993  Needless to say  a digital camera is just what I needed We decided to purchase a camera with part of our income tax refund  We didn t know what brand we were going to buy just yet  but we didn t want to spend over  300 We went to our PX on post and saw the Polaroid PDC700 at  249 00  It s got a maximum resolution of 1024x768  and an auto timer  Most other cameras in this price range I ve seen only have 640x480  It doesn t  however  have zoom on it  It came with a 4 meg memory card  4 batteries  camera to computer cable  camera to TV cable  camera case  wrist strap  ac power adapter  ac power adapter cord  Polaroid PhotoMAX Image Maker Software CD Rom  and Polaroid PhotoMAX Pro Software CD Rom I ve played with it alot in the last few days  and I m very satisfied with the pictures  I ve heard a few people complain about the image quality  but I have to disagree  While it may not be up to par for a professional photographer  for everyone else  I d say the image quality is great It also comes with an LCD screen to preview your pictures  and either keep or delete them  Keep in mind  the images will look better on your computer screen than they do in the LCD screen  That s not to say that the LCD screen is bad  It s just smaller  and pictures look a BIT grainier than they do on our computer monitor The software included with this camera is really fun  too  You can touch up the pictures  and add special effects if you d like to  There are alot of effects  some of which are embossing  oil painting  and mosaic I also really like the sleek  expensive look of this camera  It s silvery gold  and dark grey  and quite compact  Small enough  in fact  that the camera case has loops on the back so that you can slip it onto a belt  This is nice for people who are in busy areas  and might be worried about it being stolen  Personally  I m going to sew a heavy duty strap to the inside  so I can wear it like a purse  since I don t wear belts The ONLY slightly negative thing about this camera is that the batteries don t last long  Ours lasted a day  but keep in mind  we shot ALOT of pictures  We ve learned that when we are in the house  we need to use the AC adapter  and save the batteries for when there aren t any plugs around  I would recommend getting 2 sets of rechargable batteries  so that while you use one set  the other is always charging  thus cutting down on the cost of batteries All in all  I m very happy with the price  performance  and image quality of this camera  It was the least expensive I had found  and was nicer than the other more expensive ones I had looked at  This is one purchase I definitely won t regret br br  
Camera, Considering the current price range of quality mega pixel cameras nowadays  I didn t have very high expectations to begin with of my  65 camera  that came with free shipping though  My only purpose for this camera was to take pictures of items I wanted to sell on my website or ebay Three hours and two sets of batteries later  I finally was able to take some suitable pictures with the camera  I ended up having to do this outside  where the flash was not required because the flash seemed to make the already blurry pictures even less clear  Also  the smaller you resize your picture  the clearer it seems to appear  so be sure to keep that in mind This product definitely has some cool features  such as a self timer to take pictures and the different flash options  But you may not care too much about these features once you actually upload these pictures to the screen and notice the poor resolution I think this camera is a good starter for those who want to see if they would like to fork out the money for a good digital camera  If you really just want the camera to take pictures of items to sell  this camera may just be all you need  However  I might also suggest purchasing a cheap scanner instead for better quality than this camera  Also  please make sure you head to your local Sam s Club and buy some AA batteries in bulk if you plan to use this camera  You ll need them all If you would like to see pictures taken with this camera  go to http www geocities com ritasalbums br br  
Auto, When my husband bought me a 1991 Cavalier  I was so excited  I always thought they were pretty cars It was loaded  It was an automatic  seats were comfy  and I could put the seat back as far as I needed  Well  it looked nice  but it was the biggest hunk of junk ever put on four wheels  every time I went down the street something went wrong with it  First the engine cooling fan  then the engine control computer  on and on  A cheap part couldn t break on it After all was said and done  we spent  749 78 in engine work  in about three and a half months  The car never did run right again  Someone did do me a favor  they decided to put it out of its misery  and mine  by totaling it while it sat in front of my house  I don t know if the newer Cavaliers are built any better  and I don t want to find out  The heartbeat stops here br br  
Auto, My brother bought a 1992 Red Mustang Convertible and it is a pretty sweet car  Convertibles are just fun to drive and ride in  and it being a Mustang is just ten times better  This car doesn t have that much power  but it gets the job done  It is by no means a small car  but after driving a V6 Truck for a while this car doesn t have the power  The front seats are pretty roomy and I feel comfortable in them  However  in the backseat  you better be ready for a cramp job  There is no room in the back for real humans  Maybe kids under 10 years old  4 adults can sqeeze in for a couple minute drive  but not much longer  Overall good car   
Camera, I have been a 35 mm guy for over 30 years and have shot well over 15 000 images including a number of published photos and a magazine cover shot  Not bad for an amateur After looking at every consumer level digital camera  I decided on the Nikon 995 in August 2001  I shoot a combination of outdoor  landscapes and macro plus industrial photos for my work  I was drawn to the 995 because it is small enough to pack in my computer case or a fanny pack and yet has a full compliment of attachment lenses   2 fish eyes  a wide angle  2 telephotos and a slide copier attachment The camera works in the Auto mode right out of the box and is a no brainer  even for someone who has never taken pictures  Using the M or programmable mode takes some reading  The manual is over 160 pages  Even as an experienced amateur  after 6 months of use I am still reading the manual to learn everything that the camera can do in every mode I bought the wide angle lens  the 500 mm equivalent telephoto  the cable release and the slide copier attachment  The wide angle is great  The 500 mm  as you would expect from any lens of that length  absolutely requires a tripod  The cable release is a pain to use  For telephoto shots I usually use the timer in 3 second mode  push the shutter button twice The slide copier works great and is a real bargain  I have transferred over 300 slides to digital for web publishing  A whole lot cheaper than a slide scanner  and the quality is excellent After 2 000 pictures including an extensive industrial shoot for a PowerPoint presentation  about 2 hours of  MOV files  video without sound  and hundreds of outdoor images  I think I made the right choice  If you are planning on replacing 35mm as I have  you need an extra battery  maybe two  and depending on your interest in quality pictures  filters   skylight  circular polarizer  neutral density  I use 4 digital flash cards  2 128k and 2 64k  enough for a 2 3 day backpacking trip The camera is tough  I dropped it in New Orleans  no  I did not have too much to drink  on the concrete from about 4 feet  duh  Broke the rotary selector switch  which I replaced myself for  28  don t tell Nikon  and the camera is no worse for wear  You should see the electronics inside of this thing  Makes a computer look like a toy If you really want to learn to use this camera  find a copy of the Mastering Nikon Compact Digital Cameras   an eBook on CD  I learned more in 20 minutes than in six months reading the manual  Good shooting  
Camera, First off  I don t consider the E10 to be a professional camera  Due to the CCD being smaller than regular film  you can t get the depth of field control that you can get with a regular film camera  and that limits your portrait creativity  The handling of the camera is great  it feels very much like a regular SLR  by weight and by function   in record mode  In playback mode  this camera is slow  going from picture to picture  zooming  etc  very slow   my current Canon Pro90 IS is much better in this regard I wish it had interchangeable lenses  I understand olympuses decision based on the threat of dust in the lens  but using a teleconverter leaves a lot of possibility of haze from too many refractions  etc  With the Teleconverter  pictures end up quite hazy sometimes  colors lack snap  etc I really like the Oly flash  the Fl 40 performed great and is a very interesting design  Watch out for the infared focus assist  it s easy to block with your finger  and suffers from some parallax issues  but you can shoot in almost total darkness which is cool  Viewfinder is great  nothing but pleased with it  but why does it blank when you take a shot  it s not like there is a real shutter in there   I was very happy with the camera  right until it bailed off my motorcycle at 95 mph  causing it to be very quickly demolished  C est la vie  It eats through AAs  definitely carry a spare set  
Camera, This camera was my Christmas present from my husband  I have been an amateur photographer since college and own three 35mm cameras and many lens  a video camera and also collect vintage cameras  I picked this camera after researching digital cameras from all sources  web  friends  magazines  etc  What really sold me on this camera was the cover for the lcd screen display  Research told me that this was the first item to be damaged on digital cameras and that even with careful use  you could render your camera useless if the screen is damaged  The screen flips up or down allowing for some interesting shots without becoming a contortionist  The screen is bright and large enough to view photos reasonably  And the photos are great  I have enlarged photos to 8 x 10 on the highest resolution with very good results  My in laws  who also own a digital camera  commented after receiving pics emailed to them   what camera did you buy  they look fabulous  much better than the camera we own  The camera does not have a view finder  which does take a little while to adjust to if you are used to SLR or instamatics  After you adjust  you will enjoy taking more and more pictures  The menu function allows you to delete those bad shots  Other features and black and white and sepia tones  Another feature that I wanted was an optical zoom  Most digitals have a digital zoom  but the optical zoom allows more control to bring the photos up close  To review the photos you just took  it has a slide show option  The software that Sony packages with the camera is moderate  I have upgraded my software package to allow for more control and options  There are more options on this camera that I am still learning  The only disappointment is the 4mb memory stick  you can only get 4 or 5 photos at the highest resolution on this card  an upgrade is a must  
Auto, I had owned a 1990 Subaru Legacy AWD for 6 years and was very pleased with the foreign car capability and design  Therefore  I was in the market again for an AWD since I live in an area of the country with tons of snow and I spend a good deal of time driving  I made an extensive search on the internet and discovered the Audi  I had not given Audi a thought before  but thought  quot why not at least test drive one quot  So I test drove a 1992 Audi 100S  It was fantastic like no other car I had ever driven  I continued my search until I discovered the 1993 100CS Quattro  It has a more modern look  some people think it is newer than it really is  the interior leather has held up very well and the paint has only barely started to chip no rust even after 7 years  The car is a breeze to drive  There is very little road vibration felt even after riding in it for 8 hours  The seats are very comfortable and heated too  Plenty of leg  amp  head room  The quattro is excellent walked right up a hill covered with 4 inches of snow when every one else was fish tailing  The ABS are superb  What I do not like about the car is that it is a bit sluggish around 30 mph  after that look out  You really have to watch that speed  Also  as with other cars  there are some things that the home mechanic cannot fix himself  The Audi 100CS Quattro is a totally solid car  I can only imagine what it would be like to drive one new  I would highly recommend it to my friends br br  
Camera, My experience with the Canon Powershot A50 has generally been good  It takes good pictures  It s  quot point and shoot quot  features seem to be done well  it takes pictures without flash indoors with good results  for instance  It comes with good software for image management  too  although there s no simple way to just dump images to a file for later processing I hated the  user interface  at first  but I ve come to see that it s not too bad  There are   buttons on the top that are required for menu selection and scrolling it s not obvious at first  especially if you re looking just from the back  Plus  these double up for other functions  Also  it s not always clear when the camera has actually taken a picture  It does emit a beep  unless you turn it off  A friend of mine with hearing loss could not hear the beep The biggest downside is that it uses lithium batteries which are not rechargable  I used up a  10 battery in a couple of days  I was taking pictures out of doors in the cold  which is apparently a no no for lithium batteries  A  recharging kit  is available for  100  but apparently they are hard to find br br  
Camera, I was dying for a digital camera  but my college budget cringed at the price tags of the popular brands  Then I stumbled across an ad in a mail order catalog for the SiPix iQuest DualCam  At  29 after a  20 rebate  I couldn t pass it up  Was it worth thirty bucks  Well  what digital camera isn t  Here s my take on the DualCam b Hardware  The iQuest DualCam is a palm sized unit with run of the mill features for a low end digital camera  It boasts a built in flash  a lens cover that doubles as a power switch  a USB port for PC connections  and a video output jack for viewing images on any TV VCR with an RCA input The controls are well organized in five buttons on top of the camera  A quick run down of functions A single button scrolls through the flash options  On Off Auto Another button does double duty as a quality selector and self timer switch  cycling through high and low quality settings with and without the timer There s a Play Record button  primarily for use when viewing images on an external video source  Play mode lets you view and delete images  as expected  but record mode was a little disappointing  The camera displays a decent quality live feed image on a TV  but only allows you to capture still images  Several cameras on the market  some of the popular pen cams  for instance  let the user capture video on the go  The DualCam s web cam feature  however  is only available when connected to a PC  Finally  the delete and shutter buttons serve only their stated purposes It should come as no surprise that a camera in this price range isn t equipped with a built in LCD image viewer  I will give SiPix props for the layout of their status indicator  though  It s easily deciphered  even if it isn t very eye catching   Accessories  The connection ports of the DualCam bug me  They re easy to get to  but their position on the lower left side of the unit makes use as a web cam bothersome  With the cables connected  the camera tends to shift under the weight of the cords and leans to the side  Why the connections weren t taken around the corner to the back of the unit is boggling  I ve worked around this problem by clamping the cords to the side of my monitor  but it was nonetheless a nuisance The optimal solution would have been to place the connections in a cradle stand  but that would probably have jacked the price up  The stand that  is  supplied leaves a little to be desired  It secures to the camera via a short bolt with a plastic knob on the bottom  This is the same type of attachment many tripods have  but for a tiny webcam it s overkill  On a more pleasant note  the DualCam comes with all its cables  and SiPix even includes a pair of AA batteries to get you started  The people at SiPix apparently appreciate the fact that it s nice to be able to play with a new toy right out of the box b Performance  While including batteries is a nice gesture  the one pair won t save you much money  The DualCam is a glutton in the power department  Energizers in my camera have an average life expectancy of 1 2 hours  Thankfully  the unit turns itself off after a few seconds of inactivity  But the power drain is still impressive  I just wish I was as impressed by the quality of the images as I am by the device s power consumption  The DualCam offers two levels of picture quality  but despite my most intense inspections I can t see any real difference between Low and High  The only noticeable effect is that switching to high quality drops the storage capacity from 24 images to 6  When transferring images to my PC in Adobe Photoshop via the supplied software  I get 640 x 480 pictures on either setting  At a high level of zoom in Photoshop there are a few less pixel distortions  but the difference is negligible  And with no option to increase memory  the high setting certainly isn t worth the number of pictures it costs The camera seems to perform best in the 6 10 foot range  I ve managed some near disposable camera quality images at such distances  and with some creative blurring of backgrounds they don t look too bad  The clarity  however  remains far inferior to an actual disposable camera and a scanner   Wrap Up  There are other aspects of the unit that could be discussed  one second delay between shutter press and confirmation chirp  two second delay between confirmation and ready light for next picture  but I think the image quality pretty well sums up the overall experience  That s what you buy a camera for in the first place I will mention that the DualCam is adequate as a webcam  Capturing at 30 frames second  it keeps up with the rest of the pack of camera webcam combos  But if I had wanted a webcam  I would have bought just that and gotten more focused software and options  Do I feel like I was ripped off  No  not really  Despite all the shortcomings of the DualCam  it does allow me to snap occassional pictures and quickly access them through my PC  For  29 I feel good about my purchase  Had I paid any more for it  I might be less forgiving  If you re looking for a high quality digital camera  you ll have to pay high quality prices   higher than thirty dollars  at least  But if  like I was  you re simply bursting at the seams to get your own digital camera  the DualCam is a nice  cheap starter  if you can find it on sale  I m withholding my recommendation on the DualCam primarily because the quality of the images is so low  For someone who s new to the digital camera game  or who doesn t require crisp photos  this camera would still be pretty good for the price  As a brief side note  I do think this camera would make a good gift for younger users  It performs consistently  and if it gets broken or used as a coaster  you re not out  250  On that  thanks for reading my review  I hope you ve found it useful  
Auto, The 3 Series finally made sense to me recently  Since the current generation car appeared in 1999 I 146ve had trouble getting excited about it despite many opportunities to drive the car  Even after the engine and suspension tweaks a couple years ago  it always seemed smoother and less visceral than I felt a BMW should be  I wanted to have fun  but the car was pursuing technical excellence  Fun and technical excellence are not the same thing I 146ve written quite a bit about my mixed emotions towards the 3 Series before  For this review I 146ll concentrate on my recent impressions driving a 330 at a BMW sponsored driving course  I drove an automatic 325 wagon at the same event  and a manual 325 coupe at another BMW event  I comment on those in a review of the 2004 325   a href content 118909931140 here a b  In its sixth model year  this is now the oldest car in the class  How 146s it holding up b Styling and Accommodations  I 146ve never found the current 3 Series sedan and wagon strikingly attractive   The coupe and convertible benefit from more rakish proportions  They 146re certainly well proportioned and handsome in a very conventional manner  but rely on large wheels to convey the  147driving machine 148 message  A bit more edge would be nice  Just don 146t do anything crazy  Mr  Bangle  If the improvement of the 2004 5 Series over the 2002 7 Series is any indication  BMW 146s chief designer will manage to produce a design that is both striking and attractive for the next 3  due in two years  Whether the result will age as well as the current car is more dubious Inside the 3 is also very conventional  With the center stack canted much less towards the driver than earlier BMWs  very little about the interior says  147driver 146s car 148 to me  Luxury receives much more emphasis than sport  This is clearly an interior conceived before all of the recent trends towards novel textures and shapes  Again  if the improvement of the new 5 146s interior over those in the old one and the 7 is any indication  the next 3 will do just fine here  At present  however  the Audi A4 offers a higher class interior while those in the Cadillac CTS  Infiniti G35  Lexus IS 300  and even the Saab 9 3 have more character  if decidedly inferior materials  The new Acura TL 146s interior is styled somewhat like the BMW 146s  but manages to feel more up to date and sportier  When I think about it  none of the cars in this segment offers a striking  high quality  interior designed expressly for the enthusiast  So the path is wide open for the next 3 I remain less than happy with the 3 146s driving position  The instrument panel and steering column are simply too high  The new 5 does much better in this area  Again hopefully the new 3 will follow  For now I prefer the airier cockpits of the Japanese competition I have always felt that the 3 Series 146 back seat is roomier than most people seem to realize  The old 5 actually provided a fraction of an inch less rear leg room  The new 5 has a roomier rear seat  making the more expensive car easier to justify  That said  the 3 in sedan and wagon forms provides adequate room and comfort for a pair of adults in back  The coupe and convertible contain more marginal rear seats  but I still wouldn 146t mind spending an hour or two in either The trunk is the 3 is a bit tight but usefully shaped  Folding rear seats remain an option on sedans and coupes   On the Road  Make that  147on the track 148 At a recent BMW sponsored two hour driving course I drove an automatic 330 sedan hard around a track set up in the Pontiac Silverdome parking lot  Sadly the course was just long enough for me to learn how little I know about driving a car well on a track   I found it especially difficult to use the whole width of the track 151in my head I wanted to keep to my side of the  147road 148  On a more positive note  two hours was long enough for me to realize what makes the 3 series a great car  The instruction session prior to track time included a lot of talk about easy transitions between throttle and brake so as not to upset the balance of the chassis and to maintain even loads on the tires  Yet that all went out the window on the track  where the instructor commanded me to do things my common sense  and the prior classroom session  told me were crazy 151hard on the throttle  go deep into the turn  hard on the brakes  back hard on the throttle  With the instructor rapidly barking commands I was thoroughly frazzled  Thankfully  the car was not  Aside from taking out a few cones on my first fast instructional lap  the instructor said he waited too long to tell me to hit the brakes  allowing the car to enter the turn going too fast  the 330 did everything it was told to do without any untoward motions or complaints   The Continental tires were another matter 151they complained almost the whole way around the track  Even paired with the automatic the extremely smooth  wonderful sounding inline six 3 0 liter engine felt very powerful  Many shoppers will note that Infiniti and Acura offer cars with significantly more powerful engines  but somehow in the real world their advantage largely disappears  Quite likely they must use taller gearing to earn acceptable fuel economy My attitude towards serious horsepower depends on the transmission  With an automatic I love it  With a manual I often enjoy a less powerful engine  as I can still charge hard through the gears without ending up in seriously illegal territory  Consequently  with the manual I see a strong case for the 325 over the 330  Especially since the cost difference is over  5000  You do at least get a little more for the additional cash for 2004  this year the 330 manual gains an extra gear  while the 325 continues to make do with five Because the sedan was fitted with an automatic  I never felt as connected to the car as I would have liked  I 146m so used to controlling a car through a clutch and shifter as much as through the other controls that I felt like a fish out of water the whole way around the course   Keep both hands on the wheel at all times  Just steer  Given the instructor 146s insistence on keeping both hands on the wheel  something else I 146m not used to  I didn 146t much try to manually shift the automatic  That said  although things happened too quickly to pay much attention  the automatic seemed to always find the appropriate gear on its own  I certainly never felt the engine go soft as it awaited a downshift On the track the 3 146s chassis felt exquisitely balanced until very near its limit  where understeer took me into the aforementioned cones  The stability control was on  which no doubt helped maintain control  but I never felt it operate 151this seamlessness a good thing in itself  Feedback from the pedals and seat of the pants was excellent  On the track the steering 146s weighting and precision were confidence inspiring   I 146d still like a quicker ratio 151I suspect the next 3 will offer the new 5 146s  147Active Steering 148 to resolve this issue  I felt thoroughly in control of the car  I 146ve mentioned before that the 3 feels better the harder it was driven  and on the track it was driven very hard  The tires were screaming most of the way around the track  with much skittering at the rear end through fast turn exits  This skittering normally would have been my cue to back off 151except the instructor said   147Don 146t back off 148 So  aside from the chassis faithful communication of said skittering  the car felt very  very good  Since the track was set up on a fairly smooth parking lot ride quality was not much of an issue  But from my other experiences in this car I can state that BMW is well ahead of the competition is maintaining ride quality even with its sport suspensions   Jaguar and Audi are both decidedly inferior in this regard  Noise levels are very low  befitting a luxury car but not necessarily conducive to driving fun  Thankfully the inline six makes wonderful noises 151it begs to be driven hard My main issue with this car remains  however  To whit  how much time will you spend at the track  In typical suburban driving the 3 Series offers fewer thrills than many competitors  Its like Clark Kent and Superman  When there 146s no serious road work to be done  the 3 puts on the coat  tie  and glasses and relaxes  Unless you regularly drive challenging roads you might have more fun elsewhere  Of course  if you simply want to relax most of the time and save the thrills for sporadic trips to out of the way roads and racetracks  then sign right up b New Performance oriented Options for 2004  For 2004 BMW offers a couple of new performance oriented options  I have yet to sample either  but hope to in the near future  The first is a clutchless manual 151a true clutchless manual  not a manually shiftable automatic  While this transmission also has a fully automatic mode  its reason for being is lightning quick shifts in manual mode  These can be actuated using either steering wheel paddles or a manual like shifter  This transmission continues to be offered in the ultra high performance M3 for  2 400  but will be available in the regular 3  and new 5  for  1 500  As this is only  225 more than the automatic  it seems a no brainer for the driving enthusiast who doesn 146t like to use his or her left foot  I suspect the SMG transmission must have disadvantages compared to an automatic  likely shift smoothness  or there would be no point in offering a regular automatic  I plan to test drive one as soon as possible to find out   The transmission becomes available in the 5 next March  I 146m not sure when it will be available in the 3 Of more questionable value is the  147Performance Package 148  which was actually introduced last spring for the six speed 330 sedan and for 2004 is available with the automatic as well   For some reason it appears this package will not be available with the SMG  But appearances can be deceiving  The M tuned sport suspension included in this package might well respond to my major issues with the 3  But lumped in with a modest ten horse boost to the engine  18 inch wheels  a body kit  and unique seats the price is  3 900   2 700 more than the Sport Package  Assuming the revised suspension significantly sharpens up the car 146s handling  I wish it was available with only the usual Sport Package content  This would bring the price down considerably   Pricing  The 3 Series ranks with the Mercedes C Class as the most expensive car in its class   The baby Jag is priced about as high  but heavy discounting and incentives take it out of the running for this  147prize 148  If you want technical excellence  you have to pay for it 151in the low 40s for a decently equipped 330  An Audi A4 is a bit less expensive  but I found it an even more antiseptic driving experience under normal conditions  Maybe it also comes alive on the track  I wouldn 146t count so much on it  The Audi has a nicer interior but is slower and  with sport suspension  rides more harshly while still not handling as well  To save some significant bucks check out the Infiniti G35  in some ways a more entertaining if less technically excellent car  The G35 146s interior is significantly lower in quality  The new Acura TL  priced like the G35 in the low 30s  has a better driving position and design  to my eye  and a sweet V6  but cannot touch the above cars in handling  The all but forgotten Lexus IS 300 is the opposite  it pairs agile handling with a tight  cheap looking  even tacky interior  A Saab 9 3 Aero is priced like the Japanese  after rebates  but offers more precise handling together with good ride quality  Its interior quality is below the Germans  a touch below the Acura  and above the G35  A Cadillac CTS is priced nearly as high as the BMW 3  but offers nearly as much interior space as the 5  Some don 146t care for its level of interior quality  but I don 146t find it too objectionable  If anything the 2004 CTS comes too close to replicating the 3 146s chassis feel  as I 146d like more entertainment from it as well b Last Words  In the end there are no perfect cars in this class  The best car depends on your priorities in performance  handling  ride  refinement  interior room  interior quality  and styling  The BMW comes closer than any of the others to excelling on all fronts  but I cannot help wishing it were fitted with a more driver oriented  more interesting interior  quicker steering  and a more entertaining suspension  Maybe the next 3 with an unbundled M tuned suspension and Active Steering I must admit that the 330 truly came alive on a track  The problem is I don 146t spend much of my time driving a car that hard  If you do  then my issues do not apply  I neglected to mention how well I did in the final  timed lap  Heading into it  fresh from doing everything wrong on the instructional laps  I feared ending up dead last  Well  out of twelve drivers I placed totally mid pack  sixth  If only I 146d had a few more laps to unlearn a few more of my bad habits 133 My reviews of related vehicles b a href content 116178587268 Acura TL a b b a href content 77238210180 Audi A4 3 0 a b b a href content 67800436356 BMW 325 a b   2002 b a href content

Auto, I am a repeat Dodge Caravan buyer  My first one was a 1995 base model  It was a wonderful van that required no service except for oil changes  Because it had been such a dependable vehicle I never hesitated when the lease was up       I was having nothing less than another Dodge Caravan  This time though I chose to buy a more decked out model with the Sport Package  You learn from experience and I had found out from owning the first one that if you intend to keep peace between children and have room for adults riding in the 2nd row seats  you really must have captain s chairs  I found the one I liked and was quite happy with it until the air conditioner went out in the middle of July  As luck would have it I knew someone else that had the same problem just days before mine went out  So off to the dealer we go to replace some sort of switch that the service manager told me had been a common problem with the 96 and 97 model vans  A day and a half later we were on our merry way  Well at 9 000 miles the rack and pinion on the front end had to be replaced  The vehicle was less than 6 months old and I had only put 6 of those 9 thousand miles on it since I bought a dealer demo  Well they told me it would be at least 3 days and I would have to rent a car  I was not very happy and to make a long story short  after a few well placed phone calls  Dodge approved a rental car for me at their expense  Since that time  the back door has developed a leak that the service people cannot seem to stop and just this afternoon this vehicle left me stranded  The power steering has gone out and it is sitting in a parking lot waiting for a tow truck in the morning  There have been other problems along the way with the electrical system and seatbelts that had to be replaced  I think I must have got the one vehicle that has a little bit of all types of problems  Needless to say  when this lease is up  while I will still consider a Dodge  I will also be looking at other manufacturer s models too     
Auto, PROS Space and convenience  Excellent space usage and beats all the competition in adjusting seats and the folding back seat is a dream come true Ride  For being one of the largest vans in its class  it handles very well CONS Too many annoying glitches Recalls  Have had recalls on the automatic door  something about the possibility of it opening by itself while you are driving   never happen to me though  Dashboard lights  all lights turned off one fine day  They did have a recall later  Some recall in the exhaust system where they had to drill a hole in a pipe to avoid ice deposits in winter  One additional one that I can t remember Recently my check Engine light has been on and I have been to the dealership once and they could find out why  Few hours after they turned it off it is on again   I will keep you updated on how I make out Beware of the Side view mirrors   EXTREMELY FRAGILE and REPLACEMENT is EXPENSIVE   My neighbors kid pressed on the mirror and it popped off  What is worse is that the replacement cost me  130 for parts   labor  The central pivot snaps off and one has to get the complete unit including the power motor and casing replaced   I am trying to talk to HONDA about it but unless a lot of customers complain I think I am outta luck  JUST be careful about them   another friend of mine knocked it off his garage door and he paid a total of  175  Automatic sliding door doesn t stop beyond a certain point if you place your hand or another object   typically if it is less than 12 24 inches from reaching the end of the opening  Remote to unlock doesn t always work as advertised  Double click to unlock often doesn t work and one has to click multiple times on the remote  I thought it was my problem but the guy at the dealership had the same issue     
Camera, My plant recently settled on the Sony FD92 Digital Camera for our plant to use  Although against my better judgement  it turned out to be an okay purchase  Whereas it doesn t meet my own standards  it does just fine for what it is needed for   They wanted the one with the floppy disks  I had to get a new camera for my job  Of course  they put me in charge of choosing the right one  I settled on the Kodak DC4800  This was a 3 1 MegaPixel camera with a lot of optical and digital zoom  It had a 16 MB memory and had a number of options of connectivity  serial  USB  etc  It was truly first class   the Cadillac Escalade of Digital Cameras  But my co workers didn t want that one  They wanted the Sony FD92   only because it has floppy disks  It doesn t come close to having the resolution that the DC4800 has  It only has 1 5 MB  It its significantly larger and heavier than the DC4800  This was definately not in the same class   it was a Honda CRV of Digital cameras   Make due  So I had to suck it up and go with the compromise  But this camera has been okay  It takes surprisingly sharp photos of high quality  It has a really good optical zoom feature as well  I was able to take a clear photo of one of our pumps from 40 feet above  This is important when documenting damage in any of our industrial equipment   cracks  leaks  misalignments  etc  I still hold that the DC4800 is a better camera  but the Sony has been no slouch b Great Features  The Sony is relatively easy to use  It has a simple interface and is easy to navigate  You just switch between Still mode  for taking pictures  and Play mode  for viewing your photos  There s also a Recording mode for short  and I mean  short  movies  but I don t use that much  There are a couple of other nice features like being able to include the time on the photo  This is good for documenting our photos  What is probably the best feature is the ability to switch between resolutions  This will allow you to better manage your disk memory as well as take the sharpest photos when you need them b The floppies aren t that great  Although many people find them very convenient  I find that the floppy disks add an element of uncertainty in taking photos  Most prominently  floppy disks break very easily  I would hate to have a disk break on me before I was able to download it onto my computer  Furthermore  floppies are slower to access than a built in memory  They also make the camera that much heavier and expensive  The camera does come with a memory stick option   but for additional money  An 8 MB memory stick would be really helpful  I think  It just doesn t fit into our budget for this camera   Could have gotten a cheaper camera  If all we were going to get was a 1 5 MB digital camera  we could have spent half the money  The Sony FD92 cost us  579  The DC800 was  599  The extra  20 would have given us a technically superior camera  The main cost factor for the Sony is the floppy drive  But as I stated before  I don t see much of a benefit  You still have to use a computer to process you photos  Why would you spend twice as much money just because you re uncomfortable using a USB cable  Doesn t make much sense to me But all things come out well in the end don t they  
Camera, The FUJI was purchased for an inexpensive way of publishing pictures for eBay auctions  It was purchased on eBay from a dealer for a good price The unit is nothing fancy  but for the money has performed very well  With limited memory  2MB  it can hold about 6 pictures which is adequate for its intended purpose  To use personally  I d want a minimum of 8MB  The unit produces 1024x768 images which is adequate for on line use  For good photography  a higher resolution would be desirable  The unit is small and easy to use  It had a manual mode with white balance which allows good color correction for indoor lighting As with many digital cameras  have a supply of batteries available  A good alternative would be rechargeable alkaline or NiCd batteries for continued use The only problem noted is that many eBay pictures need to be shot in the range between Macro and Regular  so a couple pictures are required to decide which is best at the 18 quot  distance  If using the camera for closer or farther photography  it works extremely well br br  
Auto, I owned a Nissan Sentra for almost five years before we purchased our Quest  I never had any trouble with it at all  Needless to say  I felt I should be loyal to Nissan  As far as I am concerned  certain other car manufacturers owe me a car for the trouble I ve gone through with them  But my brother is a car salesman so I had to check out the Dodge too  The Nissan was   3 000 00 less with more features   like the rear audio  something the Dodge does not have at this point  Also  I was trading in the Nissan Sentra so Dodge offered me   1 500 00 for it  Nissan gave me   3 400 00 for the Nissan Sentra  That is quite a difference  I know that the Dodge is a bit bigger but I think those few cubic feet are not worth the price difference  Not to mention the peace of mind that I have with a Nissan  The TV VCR unit that comes with the vehicle is wonderful for my two kids and we have taken three long car trips since we purchased it in May  The seats rearrange easily although it would be nice if the rear seat would come out completely  This is a wonderful vehicle for any type of family  It is roomy  quiet  and the ride is smooth br br  
Camera, I was very keen to get into the world of digital photography  but this camera nearly turned me away from it for good I brought the MX 1200 as part of a deal with my new printer  the annoying little sales man assured me it was a  top little camera  and that I would be very happy with it  Why did I listen to that stupid little man The MX 1200 is not a good buy despite its low price tag  sure it does have a few good points  but my personal opinion is that you should save for a couple more months and by something where the pros outweigh the cons I must admit that this is a very temping price  hey I bought it  and there are some situations where this camera might be the ideal purchase  For example  if you only want a camera to use around the home then the MX 1200 might just do the job  but if your thinking of taking it out into the field or on holiday then look elsewhere  This camera has a painfully short battery life  so if you plan on being to far from the nearest power outlet be prepared to spend a fortune on batteries  Turning off the LCD screen will help to conserve power  but then  what s the point  The packaged software is just plain awful  it has minimal features and takes forever to load anything  so you may want to have a separate program like PhotoShop The other disappointing feature is the zoom  you can choose between normal or ridiculously close Other letdowns include the small media card  most shots come out blurred  no USB  and there seems to be a high error or failure rate with the uploading One thing worth mentioning if your planing on getting the MX 1200 is that the only way to get really crisp pictures is to leave the flash on for every shot  I don t know why but it just works So heres the deal  if your looking for a first camera then this might be okay depending on what you want to do with it  but I do warn you that it might just as easily put you off the world of digital photography for good  
Auto, I own a 1999 model and it has been in for constant repairs  It has a very stiff ride  very uncomfortable  handles so   so  and has terrible quality control problems  Mine has been in for numerous electrical problems  doors openning on their own  failed electronic door locks  windows  CD changer replaced 3 times  etc  The 4WD shift lever vibrates so loud when accelerating that you can t hear the radio over it  I have had it back to the dealership 3 times and they refuse to do anything about it  You also have to change the transmission fluid every 18 000 miles which is stupid  The engine is sluggish and the transmission is geared too high  The only good thing about this vehicle is the brakes have lasted a long time  In my opinion the Toyota 4 runner and Ford Explorer is a much better rig   this is the same vehicle as the Isuzu Rodeo and the Honda dealers don t like working on them  
Camera, I purchased my Olympus D 340 R about 6 months ago  It was my first digital camera purchase  and I did  A LOT  of research before I bought it  The Olympus seemed to offer the best features for the price  I didn t want rock bottom  low quality cheap  but I also didn t want to spend thousands of dollars for a top of the line digital camera I have been very pleased with the Olympus  It offers good resolution  a good amount of memory  using the lowest resolution  the camera can store about 120 pictures  I have ordered 4X6 prints of pictures taken at this resolution  and they look pretty good  If you want better quality pictures  the Olympus D 340 R can store 36 pictures at a time The D 340 R also comes with plenty of little bells and whistles  a timer  a setting to take rapid multiple pictures  a setting for close up pictures  and lots of different views of your stored pictures on the LCD screen I have 2 complaints about the camera  The first is that the LCD screen offers no menu system  and navigating around it can be confusing and I often find myself having to start over while trying to view zoom in on my stored pictures The second complaint is that using the LCD screen really eats away at your battery life  But this is easy enough to work around  minimize your use of the LCD screen  and always be sure to carry extra batteries or invest in rechargeables br br  
Camera, Before I say a thing  I must thank my dad for getting me this schweet camara for my b day last year  it is the best thing that has ever happened to me yet it has one major problem To start off  the Canon Powershoot is one of the coolest things ever  It is small  durable and the pictures are crisp and clear once you put them onto your computer Let me just say that if your lookin  to take pics that you will want to have physically to show your friends this is not the camara for you  If you want to make a handy lookin  web site or e mail your pics to fellow friends this IS the camara for you The Powershoot as many many many high tec features that I wont get into this very moment  The camara has about four settings and they all take brilliant photos  What I love about this camara is that you can actually SEE the picture as soon as you take it  and if you don t like it  than you can immediatly delete it and start over  The camara also has a great panoramic feature where you can take two pictures side by side  then patch them together for a panoramic wide lense view AWESOM  The problem with the camara is 1  You have to LOAD up on assecories since you are not supplied with them when you first by the camara  It comes with one 8 megabit chip that can hold about ten pictures at one time  no case  no strap  and no rechargable battery or battery charger just one battery that goes out very quickly  So  these assecories add up to about 500 dollars EXTRA  Thats right  I paid about this much for a batter charger  2 rechargable batteries  a case and a new 42 meg memory card that held about 100 exposures Aside from this set back  another good quality about this camara is that it can take pictures in various sizes  shapes and even color s  YEP  Thats right you have the option of taking your pictures in a black and white color  Cool huh  And when they are loaded into your compuuter  it looks as if they are taken from the olden days cool A flash is built into this camara along with an amazing DIGITAL ZOOM  I think its an 8X digital zoom but i m no positively sure  Maybe it s 4 but anyway I was at a Baseball game taking pictures and the digital zoom can get so close that it took perfect action shots of all of my favorite ball players  I LOVE IT This little camara has so much to offer  about 50 things on top of the ones I just talked about  This camara really is worth the money  you wont be dissapointed at all  If you get one digital camara this year  definatly make this the one  I will not let you down br br  
Camera, JVC has always had a good reputation for quality  but maybe this is their first digital camera  I ve owned the camera for only one month  but I have spent twice as much time reading the manual as using the camera The camera is much too complicated for the average user  To learn how to use all its functions would take me at least 6 months of full time schooling  The design is simply OVERKILL  Far to complicated for the everyday user  Instruction manual is VERY poor  In some cases totally ambiguous and unfathomable  Also  the controls are poorly designed  The so called  Power Dial   which is the main control  is cumbersome and poorly designed  The Power Dial  the Zoom control  the Mode control are are located so close together  that it s very difficult to avoid changing the Mode or switching the Power Dial to another function  Erasing photos from the Smart Media card is very cumbersome  and if you happen to let the card get full  it becomes virtually impossible  The film copy mode  for shooting negatives or slides  is very poorly explained in the manual  and even when you understand how to do it  the challenge is considerable and the results are poor Having two LCD panels  one on the back and one on the top of the camera  is a pain  Also  many functions are much too slow  Also  outdoor daylight  it s almost impossible to determine whether the picture has been taken or not  If there is a beep  I ve never heard it yet  The flash is annoying  because it s on by default and you have to turn it off before taking each picture  A royal pain that is It s an attractive looking camera  but let s be realistic function is beauty  In terms of function this camera is very ugly  If you ask about shutter lag who knows  You never when when the camera has taken the picture Also  photo quality is not nearly as good as my Canon PowerShot A20  which has only 2 1 Mega  This camera is best for professionals because the average person will go crazy trying to learn how to use it and putting up with its deficiencies  
Camera, I purchased my Toshiba PDR M 25 mainly because of the features for the price  I wanted an optical zoom and a high enough resolution picture to print well  The Toshiba seemed to fit the bill The camera takes good outdoor photographs with bright  vibrant  accurate color reproduction  There is a problem however with the lag between snapping the picture and when the picture is recorded  I have gotten several shots where the people I was photographing saw me  snap  the shot so they moved  The photo I got was of them moving   not the posed shot I intended to get  This is also a problem when trying to take a shot of a moving object  such as one of the deer that roams our neighborhood Low light photos come out grainy   like using a film camera in low light when the flash does not fire  Even with the flash on you must be close to the subject to take an indoor or outdoor evening picture  In Toshiba s defense they state that the flash is for pictures up to 8 2 feet away From reading reviews on several other digital cameras I think this must be a common complaint I have read several complaints about short battery life and I will agree with some clarification  When using the camera indoors and reviewing the pictures on the LCD screen I have had the batteries last only 10 or 12 pictures  Conversely when taking pictures outside I have taken in excess of 40 pictures on 1 set of alkaline batteries  I have read where rechargeable NiMH will last much longer than this  I have ordered some so I will soon know The camera seems to be more sensitive to movement than my 35mm Nikon  Probably because of shutter speed Knowing what I do now I would check out some of the other cameras a little closer before I purchased this one again It may be that the short comings of this camera are typical of digital cameras in this price range  
Auto, Our local Chevrolet dealer invited us to take a new 2003 all wheel drive Express Van for the weekend  We currently have a 2000 all wheel drive Astro Van that we use as both a floral delivery vehicle and personnel vehicle for vacations  etc  We where thinking about moving up to a full size van  Our current Astro Van has LS trim  8 passenger  rear AC  and in general is pretty well loaded with other options  We wanted the new Express Van to be equipped about the same  which for the most part this one was We never got to drive the Express long enough to get used to the bigger and much longer size but I don 146t think it would take very long  I think I could get used to a much roomier van  There was plenty of legroom in the front  especially on the passenger side and even the back seats had plenty of legroom for our teen age kids  Just as our Astro  the Express was an 8 passenger but the big difference was there was much more room behind the back seat  I assume if you move up to a   ton you get another seat  The seats look like they would be very easy to remove if you need to It drives like a dream  There is plenty of power and the four wheel disk brakes stop very smooth and straight  It handled really good on our local two lanes  snake like roads  And on the open highway there was plenty of power to spare  I like the way the new Express is designed similar to the Silvered pickups  I also really liked the left side rear door  a real convenience  And the rear panel doors will swing open 180 degrees  which would make it really easy to load large items such as furniture  On the Astro you have to unlatch the doors to do this Now for the con 146s  As I said  we wanted the Express to be equipped similar to the Astro and here is where it falls short  There are no storage compartments over the rear wheel wells and the rear seat backs don 146t fold down  We have gotten used to these features on the Astro  We fold down the rear seats and sometimes stack stuff on top of them  And the rear storage compartments are always used to store small items that we don 146t want rolling all over the van  There is no assist handle on the passenger side of the Express and this makes it really hard to get in  as the Express is somewhat taller than the Astro  I also noticed that the front doors do not open wide enough  With the LS trim you get some rather large  hard plastic  pockets on the door and I was constantly getting my leg stuck against them when I exited the van  There is also no twilight sentinel on the headlights  which almost every other GM vehicle has  The van is also not trimmed out as nice as the Astro  I would expect the LS package to add more carpeting on the front and side door panels but they are left all plastic All in all GM has done a very good job redesigning the Express but they need to put more Astro like features on it if they expect to attract current Astro owners  Because of these missing features I think we will wait a couple of years before we move up  Maybe GM will get their act together by then Aug  8  2003 I was reading a press release and Chevrolet has added assist handles on the passanger side for 2004  
Camera, The SONY MAVICA was one of the first digital cameras to make it to the mass market  and though it may be an  early bloomer  it is a pretty good one The Mavica is sort of like my old  68 Volkswagen  Anyone can drive it  it will endure lots of punishment and screw ups  but don t expect Ferrari style power  I bought the Mavica for two reasons  to enter the world of digital photography  and I loved the idea of just using 3 5  floppies as the storage medium instead of all those proprietary cable and chip gizmos Simple is simple It is easy to use and it has not let us down yet  It is really finicky about light settings there isn t much of a fudge factor there  as with all digital cameras  but once you get the exposure setting right you re in business  The main problem with the Mavica is that the picture is about like what you d expect from a Polaroid print  you can make out what the people look like  but don t hold your breath waiting to see if NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC will buy your images  For family stuff you can share on the internet with the family  it is fine  The main plus with these cameras  aside from the internet stuff  is that you don t have to mess with film and developing costs and you can re do any goofs  As a long time print photographer  that makes things really nice  And the neato thing about the Mavica  again  is the advantage a 3 5 floppy gives you over all those smart cards and other geeky doo dads  If you re at Grandma s and you wanna see what you ve got on the computer screen  just take out the diskette and slap it into Grandma s computer  Voila  It s working   P S  Of course it helps if your Grandma has made it into the cyberworld and actually HAS a  puter  
Auto, BUICK KICKS OFF NEW MILLENIUM WITH A SPECIAL CENTURY Buick touts the Century as a family car  with the appeal and styling of a much more expensive sedan  In nearly six months of driving the Century 2000 Special Edition  the car continues to surprise and please us almost daily The ride  the interior  storage and accessories all have proven their quality and craftsmanship in the first few months of working the car into routine  First  let s consider the ride  With a large six cylinder engine  the Century demonstrates considerably more guts in acceleration that other autos its size  In sudden acceleration bursts  the vehicle surges ahead confidently  without hesitation  providing drivers with the confidence they need in congested highway driving  Overall the motor is quiet  though it does sound throaty when you punch on the accelerator at times  The Century s power plant seems ample for highway and city driving  Steering is crisp and responsive  And the wide frame provides a smooth  even ride While the engine provides plenty of power  the interior provides ample comfort  The glove like leather seats envelope passengers and provide enough legroom for a person 6  3  to sit comfortable   with room to spare  Understandably  the Century s back seat is tight when the front seats are pushed far back  But there is still enough room for children to sit comfortably  The six way power seats make it possible for tall drivers to sit without jarring their heads against the interior roof line  The interior s best feature is its seating  The leather seating is comfortable and plush  The dashboard stands out for its simplicity and its convenience to controls  Steering wheel mounted radio and CD player controls convenient enable the driver to adjust controls without taking hands off the steering wheel  The radio plays well  with little static if any  and the CD player provides a consistent sound with barely a skip  The dashboard controls are easily within reach and conveniently laid out The dual temperature controls work well   enabling a front seat passenger to warm up or cool air flow through the ducts on that sight of the car  The automatic thermostat works fine  if comes on when the sensor determines the temperature has shifted from the programmed setting  The air conditioning is responsive  cooling a hot interior in Florida within a few minutes  and providing almost immediate relief to front seat passengers One downside is the automation and sensors on the vehicle  While the lighting works just fine  it s easy to forget to turn on your headlights   though they ll come on automatically at the onset of darkness  The keyless entry can be optionally programmed  but the default enables driver and passengers to leave the vehicle at night with the lights on for 90 seconds   a nice feature in a dark area On the upside  the rear split fold seats make it convenient to reach into the trunk during a long trip and access a cooler or other belongings  And  speaking on the trunk  it s huge  You can easily fit four medium suitcases and two large golf bags into that cavernous space The Buick Century 2000 Special Edition has exceeded our expectations  and provides a fine family vehicle for local and long distance driving 30 br br  
Auto, I have been a loyal Lexus ES300 driver for over four years now  My first was a 92 pre owned  and I now drive a 97  It is a great car  and you will always get the red carpet treatment at Lexus  For example  one of my heated seats wasn t working  and they ordered the wrong part  Because of the delay in fixing the problem  they gave me touch up paint at no charge and a discount on a CD carousel  They definitely take care of you  As I mentioned  my first car was a true pre owned vehicle  and I felt I got a pretty good deal on it  However  when I went to trade it in  I learned that they sell their loaner cars when they reach approximately 15 000 miles  at least my local dealership does  so I assume most or all do  These cars have only been owned by Lexus  they ve had all maintenance done  and they are newer with lower miles than other  quot pre owned quot  cars  which are usually several years  not months  old  I bought my car practically new at a discounted price and didn t take a huge  quot new car quot  depreciation  I don t think this is something they actively market  because I never heard about it until I started asking questions and got a good sales person  In summary  I highly recommend this car and also suggest their pre owned loaner cars br br  
Camera, The Sony Mavica FD83 is a wonderful camera for ANYONE   beginner to pro I bought my Mavica over a year ago and was completely clueless to digital cameras  It has been a great camera to begin and learn on  it s so simple Thiscamera comes with an in depth manual that is very easy to read and understand  It comes with a nice carrying case   It comes with a  quot Infolithium quot  battery pack that holds a full 210 minute charge  Also included with the camera is the charger  The Mavica FD83 has many features such as  date and time  option to record still or moving pictures  auto or manual focus and picture effects You can select picture quality and size  It offers different playback modes to view your pictures right on the camera  You can even erase a picture you take if you don t like it  One of the best thing about this camera is it takes 2Hd floppy disks  You can take your pictures and insert them right in your computer  It s that easy The camera surface is easily cleaned with a damp cloth  The screen surface as with any must be cleaned with a LCD cleaning kit This camera was an excellent investment  I have had no problems at all with it and would recommend it to anyone     
Camera, This camera  the Olympus D 460Z  has caused me all sorts of headaches  I love to use it so much that I ve been compelled to buy all sorts of accessories that I can t afford  I purchased it because it felt good to me  compact  attractive  nice pictures  no lens cap to lose  Since that fateful day  however  I ve made many trips back to Best Buy  I bought more memory cards  8 MB isn t nearly enough  a battery recharger  that screen is so fun to use  a SanDisk USB Smartmedia card reader  I didn t like having to plug my camera in constantly  and this is so much faster  photo paper  a case  and the worst  a new HP deskjet 970cse  what s the point of having this awesome camera without its printing equal Truly  though  this camera is great  and I ve heard the new Olympus models are even better  It is small and light enough to fit in my purse  and I don t have to worry about it turning itself on  you have to slide the lens cover over to turn it on  or scratching the lens  The battery consumption is pretty good with the screen on  and excellent without it  The picture quality is great  and the autofocus seems to be better than most cameras  The optical zoom is something that I now realize I can t live without  it puts the digital zoom on most cameras to shame  The different light and picture settings are easy to access  the menu system is very easy to use  I was am a digital photo novice  but I don t foresee my self outgrowing this camera anytime soon     
Camera, This is my first review  so if I ve missed anything out  please don t hesitate to leave a comment   I ll try to answer any questions  I was looking for reviews on the Olympus MJU 300 digital camera and found none  so thought I d set the ball rolling  So here goes  N B  I live in the UK  so some aspects of this review might not apply  but I ll try to keep it as product related as possible I had decided to buy a digital camera because I am moving to France for a year and wanted to record my experiences there  I started off by just browsing the different cameras in my price range  around  300    480  I was immediately drawn to the MJU 300 because it looked so sleek and attractively designed  especially compared to some of the Nikons  which were far bulkier  Having shopped around  I finally paid  243  including a 10  student discount  US  390  To be honest  I was more in the market for a point and shoot camera than anything particularly professional  but I did some research to make sure I was getting the best spec  for my money  I was particularly impressed by the zoom quality  the movie mode and the generally sharp  clear pictures it gave me when I was trying it out and my opinion has not changed in the weeks I have had the camera  I bought an upgrade for the picture card and can now store 160 pictures on the camera at a time  which is plenty for me   I didn t feel the 16MB card was enough  I found setting up the camera simple to say the least and the battery only took 2 hours to fully charge from new  They even included a Continental adapter so I can use it easily in France  we have different electricity plugs here  How convenient  Having taken my pictures  I then set up the software on my computer  Many of my friends have had problems transferring their photos from their camera to the PC  but the software provided was excellent  simple  easy to use and yet still powerful  I have  as yet  had no problems transferring  editing   printing images  It is wise to read the manual properly first as Olympus use symbols for different functions and commands  so it s a bit confusing if you don t learn what they mean first  You get the hang of it really quickly  however  and after that it s no problem  My one complaint would be that there was no case provided and I have had difficulty finding one to fit   you need something to protect the screen from scratches and surely it wouldn t cost much to provide a basic  cheap pouch  especially as they even went to the trouble of providing 24 months free cover with www yellowtag com  The camera itself  however  has been wonderful   it looks great  is easy to use and takes excellent photos  I would recommend without hesitation  
Camera, Digital cameras have come a long way since I got my first one in 1992  Back then  they were black and white  grayscale in computer terms  but black and white in photographic terms  had poor resolution  were expensive  were slow  and transferring images to a PC was an ordeal  This camera shows just how far the medium has come in a bit over a decade The Visioneer MX200 is an entry level digital camera  While it lacks the features found in more expensive cameras  it still boasts a 2 megapixel resolution  which is sufficient to produce clear  sharp pictures up to 8 by 10 inches  It sports an LCD display  which is de rigeur for digital cameras these days  It has 8MB of internal memory  which in theory can hold up to 66 pictures in  normal  resolution  However  in  super  resolution  it can hold seven  There are also three intermediate resolutions with intermediate capacities   Super  resolution can be thought of as normal resolution compared to the better digital cameras on the market  so if you want clear  sharp prints that can survive cropping or enlarging to 8 by 10  then you better stick to the maximum resolution  which is 2048 1536 Although the memory issue seems like a limitation  the camera supports SmartMedia cards  A 128MB card cost me  39 with a  10 rebate  29 net  and that brought the capacity up to 145  super  resolution pictures  If you want more capacity  you can buy several cards  use lower resolution  or just upload the pictures to your computer more frequently  If you are satisfied with 4 by 6 snapshots or plan to use the camera for web photos only  then the internal memory at normal resolution should be adequate  and a similar SmartMedia card can give you about 900 photos The camera comes with a built in flash  settings for white balance and flash  including an automatic one for each  a macro setting  and a setting for portraits  landscapes  and night scenes  as well as a self timer  The camera can also be used in PC mode as a PC camera with applications such as Microsoft NetMeeting  The camera can record video clips up to one minute long  albeit without sound There is also a 3 1 digital zoom  As with many digital cameras  a digital zoom is a poor substitute for an optical one  I read elsewhere that since the number of pixels in the CCD is fixed  the camera must make use of an algorithm to map zoomed pixels onto the CCD  and unless the zoom amount is an even multiple  you end up losing quality  Likewise  if you decide to just crop the picture later  you will lose quality since editing a JPEG and saving it as a JPEG causes loss of resolution  Needless to say you cannot find analog zoom on any cameras in this price range as of this writing  However  I did find that photos taken without the zoom appeared to be of better quality The camera comes with a case  strap  USB cable  video cable  for TV hookup  software  instructions  and dead batteries  Customer support acknowledged that many users reported that the batteries were dead after only two or three pictures  Mine did not last so long and the camera told me to change my batteries before I took a single picture According to the documentation  the camera should be used with alkaline batteries only  In another area  it says that it comes with alkaline or NiMH batteries   It comes with alkalines  In yet another section  it states that alkaline or NiMH batteries should be used  Alkaline batteries are not very useful in this camera  If you use them  you will need to keep the LCD screen off  and you will run out of batteries after a dozen pictures or so  If you leave the camera on by mistake  it happened to me once when the button got pushed even though it was in the case  then you might get only two pictures from a set of alkaline batteries  I bought a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for  5 99 and the camera has been doing fine ever since  The battery life rating I gave referred to the batteries supplied or any AA alkaline batteries used to replace them  If you try to take flash pictures with alkaline batteries  be prepared to turn the camera off afterwards to let the batteries rest before you can use it again The camera accepts an AC adapter  but there is no mention of it in the documentation  The Visioneer website mentions that you can use a 3V 1000mA converter  It does not say the plug size or that it needs to be a converter with DC output  However  once the support person gave me the model number of an adapter from Radio Shack that works  I was able to find out most of what I need to know   Such adapters come with multiple plugs or entitle the user to a plug that fits the unit in the case of Radio Shack  Other parts related to the functionality of the camera are lacking in the documentation  For example  the explanation of the status LED says that you can take a picture when it is a solid green  but you must wait when it is blinking  However  it does not say why the camera does not work when the LED is amber  I will update this section if I ever find that out The documentation says that the camera features  Advanced Stepless Digital Zoom  Superior ADZ  but there is no explanation of what ADZ tm  is  The instructions for the preset modes neglect to tell you how to get to them  You must first set the dial to PRE SET  This may be obvious when you have the camera and are used to it  but if you read the manual ahead of time  or without the camera in front of you  it makes no sense The troubleshooting section of the documentation is far from comprehensive  and if you have enough savvy to know how to check the batteries  there is a battery level indicator on the screen  but it s obviously useless if your batteries are completely dead  turn the unit off and make sure that the memory card is in correctly  it s of little use Customer support is fair  There is an on line web based system that tells you much of what is left out of the manual  but not nearly enough  When I spoke to the customer support folks  they were not able to tell me much beyond what is available on line  What they did tell me in some cases  if accurate  did not instill confidence  In the case of the AC adapter  I was told that all they know is what was in their database and it came from a customer who tried it and it worked  When I told them that what the website said was inadequate  they did not seem concerned with updating it When it comes to getting photos to your computer  the task is painless  If you load the drivers from the CD  then Windows will detect the camera as it does with any plug and play device  The camera will then appear as an external drive  and you can copy pictures using standard Windows tools  I did not test this with a Mac  but it should work  The camera will organize photos in folders by date  There will be a subdirectory for each date on which photos were taken  and photos within the directory will have a name composed of the date and a serial number  07280001 jpg would be the first photo taken on 7 28th  The camera also comes with  Digital Camera Utility  software that allows you to select and download photos  However  the software is not rich enough in features to warrant any sort of praise  nor did I feel that I really needed it  If you already have software for viewing and editing images  it s not an issue When I got my first digital camera  I was beta testing it for Logitech  It was the first consumer oriented digital camera on the market  It lacked features  and could not handle many contrast situations  For example  photographing African Americans was not possible if you wanted facial features to be discernable  By contrast  in high resolution  this camera will produce images and prints up to 8 by 10 inches that rival that of a good  but not professional quality  35 mm camera  That s assuming that you do not zoom  and you compose the picture properly and use the proper settings  However  the default settings will work as well as one would would expect from many cameras with automated settings  and the LCD display will give you an idea of what to expect if you use other settings The bottom line is that it s a cheap camera that takes good pictures in the camera s most basic mode  It will not compare in quality to a high end digital camera  but if you are used to an inexpensive 35mm camera and wish to go digital  this should be more than adequate  Be prepared to spend a bit more on memory  30 50  batteries and charger  6 30  and an AC adapter  12 20  Ultimately  if you want the convenience of longer usage  the ability to leave it plugged into your PC  and the ability to store more photos  the price can easily double  So check out whether more expensive models come with these features as standard before you decide if this is the camera for you  That s especially true if you may need to buy an aftermarket image editing tool that may come for free with a more expensive camera  
Camera, This must be the worst full size digital camera I have ever had It s bulky size and weight makes it nearly impossible to carry with you  If you are  however  brave enough to attempt it  I strongly recommend purchasing a reinforced carrying case  as I have had the experience with ripped straps on cases form this camera The 1 9 Megapixels in this camera looks like 0 9 in another  The photos will look excellent on the LCD screen  but when transferred to a PC or printed  the poor quality of the lens becomes evident The fact that the  memory card can not be removed  is binding to say the least  You are limited to a certain number of photos you can take and if you are not anywhere near a PC  where you can download your pictures and get them off the camera s memory card  you re out of luck   It s like having a camera with a roll of film stuck in it The workmanship of the camera leaves much to be desired  as well  I had to replace the batteries once    this thing goes through batteries like you wouldn t believe i  and the slider that keeps the batteries in the camera broke  It will no longer close  I ve resorted to putting a rubber band on the camera to keep it working  
Auto, I bought my 1998 Intrigue GL in the beginning of 1999 with 12 000 miles on it a lot lower price than a new one  I first saw the Intrigue in an episode of the X Files and I thought that it was a sharp looking 4 door  I had no plans on running right out and buying one but when my wifes car started to go we started looking  We found a slightly used Intrigue GL and just couldn t pass it up The car has excellent power from the 3800 Series II engine with a smooth  equally matched transmission  There is plenty of interior room both in front and in the rear seat  The trunk is spacious and with the fold down rear seats offers even more hauling capacity  The automatic dual climate control system is great  especially for couples who have two different opinions on how hot or cold the car should be Overall  this car is an excellent deal  I would recommend it to a friend with no quams  I just wish that the car was a bit sportier but I intend to take care of that by adding a spoiler br br  
Auto, I bought my 1991 Grand Am brand spanking new  It s a 2 door coupe with a 2 5 liter fuel injected 4 cylinder engine  At age 11  it now has 293 000 miles on it  Same tranny  same engine  Overall  it runs great  We replaced the heater core in 1994  clutch kit in 1994  motor mounts and other small items over the years  Also regular maintenance including brakes  plugs  etc  since day one  We are on our fourth starter  third one in a year  and fourth alternator  All are remanufactured In June 2001   at about 270 000 miles  the car started  bucking  then stalling  They replaced the fuel pump  original one  but that didn t work  After much misdiagnoses  turns out to be the crankcase censor and ignition module Fast forward to June 2002  293 000 miles  We stop the car for errands and restart minutes later won t start  Will turn over  but won t catch and start up  Let it sit for a while then it s fine  Mechanics said it was starter  They replaced it  making starter  4 I mentioned above  but that wasn t the problem  More diagnoses and they said it s the fuel pump  So they replace it a year after we replaced the original one  Warranty is one month expired Windows are a PAIN  I bought this with no A C so we roll the windows down every day  Many times the windows come off track and the clips break  Console cover broke years ago  What do you expect  It s made of plastic Gas cap lever broke long ago  The spring popped and I had to do what one of the previous reviewers here had to do make sure something was holding the lever in the up position so I could run to the other side of the car to open the lid to the gas tank  I used rubber bands and hooked it to the lever that moves the seat  Nowadays my husband pops the lid from inside the trunk  Paint job  The paint started to chip way back when it was about 5 6 years old  It s still holding up but it s fading pretty fast on the roof of the car  
Auto, I bought my VW Beetle last March  I chose it because it was relatively inexpensive  I no longer needed a  quot family car quot   we have another one for that  and I wanted something amusing and distinctive  but at the same time reliable and safe  and the Beetle s safety rating  for a car its size  was impressive  Finally  I often drive into New York City  where having a car that has a short wheelbase is definitely helpful as one looks for a place to park on the street Since I wanted the car is bright blue I had to wait two weeks for it to arrive from Mexico  Otherwise  however  I bought the standard 2 0 liter gasoline powered model with no extras  I open the windows with a crank  if you can imagine that  Transmission is manual  since the engine is much more zippy that way  Avoiding a lot of extras kept the price way down so soon I will have it all paid off  When I drove it out of the lot I was delighted with it  and now that 9 months have passed I can tell you that it has been a pleasure to have this car  Nothing has gone wrong  and since the car comes with 2 years  or 20 000 miles  of free service  I have not had to spend a penny on it other than for gas  The dealer  Barry in Newington CT  has been superb  in that they have have been solicitous even AFTER selling the car  and helpful at every turn Then again  every car has drawbacks  I suppose  My major complaint with the Beetle 2000 is that VW won t supply a radio with built in compact disk player  The best that I could get was a player in the trunk  which is nowhere as convenient  I hope they fix that in future models  Other things they should fix in future models  there is no way to leave the car with an attendant at a public garage and give him the key while keeping the trunk and the glove compartment secure  One key opens all  and once in the car an inner latch opens the trunk  Also  in the winter when there is snow and ice on the windshield  the windshield wiper tends to lift in the center  leaving an area poorly swept  In addition  this car is not meant for someone who wanders off the main road  ground clearance is extremely low so any obstacle hits the bottom  Finally  I am glad that I got a car with good gas mileage considering the price rise over the past six months   however I should point out that the mileage I have been getting is 27 miles per gallon    pretty good but not the same as what the sticker said  31 miles  I didn t get the diesel  which has a lot better mileage  because I drive in many places where there are few or no stations that carry diesel  especially at night  This may not be the right car if you have to drive around with a big family  but for occasional back seat occupancy  it is remarkably comfortable in the back  and the way the seat moves forward makes it easy to get in br br  
Auto, We bought this truck because my husband wanted a 4 wheel drive vehicle  We were interested in z71  but the price turned us off  We purchase a 1999 b3000 4 wheel drive king cab truck and are very pleased with its power  towing ability  and comfort  It has an excellent stereo system and we have only encountered a few problems  First we had a bolt come loose on the drive train which caused a vibration  we took it to the dealership and they fixed it  The dealership also fixed a Cruise control that was recalled  but in the fixing made the windshield wipers come on when you hit a dip in the road  this provided several good laughs and has since been fixed  These little set backs don t eliminate our joy of owning this truck  You should purchase this truck if you are looking for full size power and ability without full size price br br  
Camera, Let Me Start off By Saying that I have owned 2 Previous Digital Cameras Kodak DC 210 Plus and a Sony Mavica FD 90  So I do write this review with some expirence  Ok  I just got this camera at Best Buy for  999 on Sunday Oct  27 2001  I was headed there to get a Replacment for my FD 90 Read My Review on this Camera  and originally intended to spend anywhere between  700 800  and NOT Get a Sony Read the FD 90 review and you Will Understand  However that Marketing appeal of Sony Sucked me in  and only 2 minutes from the time I walked into Best Buy  I was walking out with a new Digital Cam  Why did I choose Sony after I vowed never to get a Sony again  Well for 2 simple reasons  the 5 24 MegaPixels  which is the most for a digital camera to date  and the Rechargable lIon Batteries  Having a recharageable battery is AWESOME for a Digital Camera  those AA batteries get expensive after awhile  I like the memory sick solid state storage format because they are tiny and can fit anywhere Plus You Can Trick your Friends with it  and tell em its a stick of gum   hehe  They are small  and hold a ton of data Amazing what the World has today  How Many Pics can a Memory Stick Hold  Well Im glad you Asked  On the Highest Resoultion 5 24 MegaPixels  You can get about 8 Pics on a 16mb Memory Stick  Yup Thats right  each Image is 1 8mb in size  not for a Dial up user  I do Not Recommend this camera for a beginner camera simply because there are WAY too many features to use  Im still trying to figure out half of them  I like the Night Framing Feature  It uses the NightShot infa red to let you frame your pics at night  and then turns off and uses the flash to illuminate the pic That was the main problem I had with the FD 90  at night it was next to impossible to properly frame a photo at night  however it can easily be done with the F707  It also has a Night Shot mode  just like on the camcorders  you can take Green InfaRed shots in pitch black darkness The F707 has a Dual LCD Screen  and a LCD Color Viewfinder  This is really nice  because when your at a play or somewhere dark you really dont want a Bright LCD screen illuminating everyone around you  so you just turn the Screen off and Look into the viewfinder  its that simple That About Does It for My Review of the DSC F707 For Photo Samples comparing the DSC F707 vs  The Mavica FD 90  please send a email to photorequest2001 yahoo com with a Subject of Photo Thanks  
Auto, I purchased my 2002 Trailblazer in July of 2001 in Vermont  Before winter hit the windshield wipers started to intermittently stop working before all together failing  I had the motor replaced and away I went  On the week before Thanksgiving 2002 the wipers failed again in a rainstorm in Plattsburgh  New York  Again back to the dealers which they replaced the motor again  A week after moving down to North Carolina I had the reverse problem with the wipers  after setting the control to low speed I could not slow or stop the windshield wipers without shutting of the engine  I called GM on their hotline which was located in the back of all the GM manuals  and asked them why and when this problem would be resolved  They were trained right to say nothing but  We just want to help you solve the problem at hand  After arguing with them for 25 minutes  I conceded and Delivered it the the local GM dealership Hendrix Chevrolet  It Was friday afternoon and I told them I needed it back for monday morning  Saturday afternoon I heard nothing so I called and they said they were working on the heat cool problem that they could not seem to reproduce  After fighting with 2 managers to get a rental that they were to provide and I didn t get  I drove the vehicle home I decided to trade the Trailblazer in and after reading the reviews on this website  I bought a car  Infiniti G35 Sedan and now I m not worried about driving something that might leave my wife stranded Other Problems encountered in mine  Unbearable noise when just the rear windows are open  Bad gas mileage  Averaging 16 mpg  and poor cornering ability as all SUVs The motor idle was high at cold starts  and it felt that the automatic transmisson would hold up through the years The wife said before trading it in that the transmission was shifting funny  I received a bad trade in due to the incentives on new GM products available now I felt it important to write this since I bought my car through commits form others and reviews from auto magazines PS  A friend of mine also has a trailblazer and he complains about the feeling of the rear while driving I might of gotten the lemon  Thats why I only gave it a below average review  but at least their are some things to look out for while test driving a Trailblazer Good luck in your vehicle purchase  
Camera, This was our first foray into digital camera s and I can t say how much we love this camera It is extremely easy to use  You have three options for quality of picture  The higher quality the fewer amount of pictures the camera will hold  You can purchase additional reusable memory cards so that you don t have to download your pictures to be able to take more It also has the l e d  display  I don t know why you would buy a digital camera without a display  It also comes with a flash The one bad point of the 780c is that it does not have zoom  Most digital cameras do not come with zoom  The reason being is that you can enhance the pictures once they are downloaded on the computer  A zoom would be nice built into the camera but I would not let this fact stop you from buying this camera It seems durable  We have taken it to the beach  stuffed it in suitcases  and found our two year old bouncing it on the floor  I purchased this camera on line for under 200  Look for a deal on this camera and you will probably find one  I would recommend this camera to anyone as a good starter camera br br  
Camera, I m going to be honest with you all  I do not know much about computers or the equipment that inevitably comes with them  I don t really understand all of the technical stuff  but I can make a well informed opinion based on my results  because  as they say   quot seeing is believing quot  My parents first bought this digital camera last summer for their business  Of course  seeing a new toy  I wanted to play with it  The only problem I had was that I did not have the directions  Luckily this was not a problem as SONY made this product so easy to use that instructions were not necessary to perform its most basic functions  While I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this digital camera was to use I could not have been more shocked as to its overall quality  Not having a scanner  and hoping to use specific pictures for a possible web page  we decided to simply use the camera to take a picture of our pictures  The quality of these images  pictures of pictures  is great  Except for the flash mark  which can easily be edited out  there was almost no indication that it was taken with a digital camera  While some people may not be surprised by this at all  I was shocked because previous pictures I had seen taken with a digital camera were grainy and it was obvious that they were taken with a digital camera  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone considering a digital camera for either their business or personal use br br  
Camera, The Fuji FinePix A101 is a serious tool for making clear concise photography  It has the power and efficiency to handle the demand of professional photographers needs  while it puts the pleasure of simply great photographing back in the hands of amateur photographers I had originally intended to purchase the Finepix as an inexpensive camera for my wife to use  My wife is not a photographer  however I just showed her which button to push and she now takes perfect photos The camera offers a duality in perspective of photo capabilities  It has a fully automatic range of settings for flash and sensory which is necessary for my wife s photo pleasure  The second perspective is that it is a completely flexible camera in the way a photographer can manually set the camera to perform under different ambience and intensities  It is after all a 100  35mm camera and senses at a range of 1 2  7 square pixel length CCD or otherwise known as 1 3 mega pixels  I can set these sensory options to make photos of up to 1280x960  fine  or 640x480  normal  pixels  This Camera can also sequence up to 20 seconds of video without sound  One of the Greatest benefits about the FinePix is it s size in conjunction to it s power  The FinePix does a heavy weight job of taking up to 200 high quality normal photos using 3volt NImH batteries and a 64mb Smart Media Card  while weighing in at only 145 grams  5oz Here are just a few more of the benefits of the FinePix A101 200 normal quality photos which are worth five rolls of 35mm film  This camera has a power saving feature which will more than amply allow for this feature to produce even more photos of a smaller pixel length  The FinePix auto or manual focus Range is from 2 6 ft to infinity with either the automatic or manual 6 modes of white balance  It has an automatic or manually set flash built in The FinePix is one of the smallest cameras in the world  which includes a 1 6 inch  55 000 pixels  color LCD monitor  This Monitor zooms in for close up photography The FinePix connects to most PC computers under Windows via USB port to download your photos to an online photo developer lab or to email them to friends The FinePix comes with simple software   and easy to read manuals The FinePix shoots up to 20 seconds of video  no Sound  The FinePix can be used as a Web cam for online video conferencing The FinePix is the most powerful camera in its digital camera size bracket 3 9 x 2 5 x 1 6 inches I am a nonsmoker  but as most tee shirts and sweaters sometimes come with that smoking pocket for cigarettes than what better a place for this small and powerful camera Now when someone seeing the bulge in that smoking pocket  asks me for a cigarette I pull out the FinePix and take a snapshot of a disappointed would be smoker What is really smoking about the FinePix is it s low retail price  and cost effectiveness as a digital camera in comparison to the cost and quality of the other brands There are very many different ISO accessories that will fit the camera  which means they are all not necessarily manufactured by Fuji  Although Fuji does have everything you will need to get an inexpensive start with the best small camera on the digital camera market  You will find that OTHER Camera manufacturers make only proprietary accessories for their cameras  and other accessories won t fit their cameras  but that s never a problem with a Fuji FinePix Camera I had originally purchased the Fuji FinePix as an easy camera for the wife to use  but now instead I prefer it to the heavier power models I own  It has the power to do the job  and the size that makes taking it with you easier I am totally Happy with the Fuji FinePix A101 Camera   
Auto, I bought my new 04 Special Edition Jeep Grand Cherokee only about 2 weeks ago and have only 1000 miles on it  So far  everything is great and I look forward to driving it every day  The Special Edition offers a nicer trim package with color side moldings  no plastic on the outside  a better stereo  fog lights  and an upper console information system  gas mileage  temperature  compass  etc  I live in Atlanta so I opted for the six cylinder engine with two wheel drive  I m no speed demon and I don t intend on getting my new Jeep dirty by going off road  I love the way the Cherokee handles on the roads  it s tight and very responsive  The engine is very quiet along with the overall ride of the Jeep  I was very impressed by the low wind noise I was expecting to get on my first test drive  All the controls are at easy reach and easy to read and operate  I like the delay feature on the rear window wiper  my last SUV only had on and off  The stereo has an amazing sound that fills up the cabin with extreme clarity  it makes my drive time more enjoyable  The Cherokee has plenty of storage compartments to offer and I especially like that they put the full size spare tire on the inside of the vehicle so in case of a flat  you re not outside trying to down reel a dirty tire from underneath  Both the rear hatch and glass open separately which can be a blessing when hauling larger items  One thing I don t care for is the way you have to pull up the back seat in order to fold down the back rest so it lays flat  You have to take the headrests off  find a place to put them for a moment  pull up the seat cushion  pull down the back rest  and then place the headrests in their small slots to be stored  Jeep could have taken a lesson from some of the other domestic engineers and figured a way to pull one lever and have everything move forward and lay flat in one motion  The only other complaint I have is where the window and door lock controls are placed on the door panels  I felt it would be easier if they could place them further toward the dash so it would be easier to operate  Other than the two complaints I have listed above  I can t find anything I don t like about my new Jeep  The gas mileage was a bit better then what I expected so I really don t have any complaints in that area  This is an SUV so if gas consumption is an issue for you  don t buy any SUV  Like I said  I am very impressed with the mileage I am receiving so far  As you can tell by now  I am no serious review writer but I can tell you that I am very happy with my new Jeep  I hope to get many years of enjoyment out of it  
Camera, I love almost everything about this camera  I have owned mine for over one year and I have few complaints  and high praise Let me start by saying that I rate and have expectations from the camera relative to what is it  Meaning  I would not buy a Geo Metro and expect a BMW  That being said  for a 1 5 mega pixel camera I find the picture quality excellent  I have reproduced many of the photos on print I have taken through my local printshop  The printed quality of the digital photo prints rivals most non digital prints I was able to compare at the shop on many occasions  There are enough features in the camera to allow you to customize your photos and picture taking style  You will not feel as if you are simply at the mercy of the camera  The Auto shutter feature is a great way to capture action shots where you can not simply say  OK  hold it right there  You can activate the slow shutter mode  with or without the use of the flash  to create cool effects such as motion blurring The 3x optical zoom gives a feel of a conventional camera and is very useful  While many camera have higher level digital zooms  you will often find the you wind up seeing what the camera THINKS the distant object looks like through the use of refined digital interpolation  sometimes it is good sometimes not  An optical zoom is just that  optical  through the lens  not electronics  Although only 3x  you will find it a true representation of the object photographed  The Macro feature on the camera will let you focus down to a few cm of an object  Using the macro you can photograph things as fine as the fine print of a newspaper with ease The digital LCD screen is a perfect size and high resolution  but you will find it is nearly useless in bright sunlight  In these cases  using the built in viewfinder will yield equally good photos The controls are located perfectly  however some buttons are a bit small and you might find it easy to fat finger a button from time to time  All silver clouds have dark linings  or is that the other way around  anyway there are a few downfalls The auto timer on the camera does not allow you to modify the same settings that you can when you are taking pictures normally  I have found this a minor problem and have taken some of the best remote photos in my life with this camera If you have a very sharp eye you will notice that photos tend to have a slight fisheye perspective  If you were to take a photo of an object with perfectly straight parallel lines from top to bottom at the furthest edges of the useful display  you will note that the lines curve outward slightly in the middle and inward at the top and bottom  Like I said  unless you have a sharp eye and are looking for it you may never notice it  I use my camera for business and often have to take pictures of telecommunication equipment racks  which are pretty straight  This camera EATS power  The battery takes some time to charge and has little to show for it when it is charged  A second battery might be needed to get the most flexibility out of the camera  I find that I try to use the LCD screen only to view photos  and not to take them  This greatly adds to battery life The serial interface should be a last resort  unless you like long waits  This really has nothing to do with Fuji or the camera  it really comes down to the speed of the serial bus in today s computers  I would suggest an aftermarket SmartMedia reader  either floppy or USB based  I personal own a ScanDisk USB SmartMedia reader  which allows instant access to my photos  without killing the camera battery in the process  Last but not least  don t drop it  No kidding  right  After all it is a camera  The die cast shell might give you the false sense of durability  but believe me the inside of this camera is packed tightly  Drops or hard shocks will damage it easily Other then that this camera is a dream  I would recommend it to anyone  At the same time I would recommend four other options External SmartMedia reader   Speeds things up and saves battery power Extra Smart Media of 16 or 32 Meg   The 8 Meg Smart Card is just too small and will only allow for about 14 16 Hi Res  pictures Extra Battery   Because when the battery dies and you are away from home or the hotel  you are out of luck Tripod   Great for timed shots  or when you use the slow shutter setting  Unless you can hold yourself robotic like still  
Camera, Great  One word  I used to have the Mavica FD 73  until it was  quot misplaced quot  at a car show  I operate a very graphic intensive website that require frequent updates of pictures and images  Every since losing my FD 73  I have been looking for a replacement  I wanted something with superb zoom  yet easy to use and transfer pictures to my computer  Although this unit was much bigger than its competitors  the features more than made it up for it Since most of my images end up on the web at 300x400  I wasn t too concerned with the megapixel rate nor the quality  My main goal was to have a camera that can ZOOM  I use it mainly at car shows and events where I can t get too close to the performers or entertainers  With this incredible 20x zoom  I m able to take quality pictures without having to dig my way through a crowd  I used to prefer to use my Canon Rebel 2000 over the FD 73 because my pictures turn out better when using a view finder  I didn t like to have to rely on the LCD screen to frame my shots  But the trouble with taking real pictures is the after process of developing  scanning  and resizing  One of the main selling points of the FD 95 is its view finder  which evidently has a  quot eye sensing quot  feature to avoid battery drain  The main reason Sony Mavicas are such hot sellers is because that they take floppy disks over smart media or cards  Floppy disks are cheap  The FD 95 allows me to record in 640x480 and up to 1600x1200 resolution  So no matter what resolution I decide to use  I can always have a stash of floppies in my bag to store them in  At 640x480  I can get as many as 35 pictures on to one floppy  I elected to buy the 64mb memory stick with floppy adapter which could store 5 600 pictures at one time  I still carry at least 5 floppies with me in case someone with me wants a copy of the pictures I m taking  Sharing pictures with  25 floppies are much cheaper than letting friends borrow your memory card  then worrying when they will return it The battery that comes with the FD 95 lasts about 2 230 images on average  This camera doesn t come with a charger  instead you get a cable that attached directly onto the camera  Therefore  you can actually use the camera while it is charging  I ve also got the extended Sony InfoLithium battery which allows for 3 350 pictures per charge  A good investment if you take a lot of pictures while traveling The camera also comes with a hot shoe  but unfortunately you have to use the Sony external flash  I thought that any flash would work with it since the internal flash is often insufficient for taking pictures in poorly lit areas  such as car show buildings and night clubs  Most people who see my camera complain about the size  Yes  it is quite a large camera compared to most digitals available  I personally prefer larger cameras as they feel more comfortable in my hand  A big guy holding a tiny little camera looks funny to me  I ve always had the perception that big cameras make the photographer look professional  lol  If you can get past the size and a little bit slower in image recording time  then this is the camera for you  I take an average of 4 500 pictures per event I attend so I am used to carrying a bag anyway  Now instead of rolls of film  I have a surplus of floppies and a batter or two     
Auto, The relative popularity of the RAV4 is curious  It s attributes include nimble handling  smooth transmission  and optional AWD  but it s not particularly roomy  What s the point of an SUV if it s not roomy and has questionable off road ability  The engine is pitifully weak  often revving to over 4 000 rpms for adequate power  especially with the auto  The interior fittings are definitely not appropriate for its price  The only pieces of soft touch plastic are the steering wheel  shifter and the interior door grab handles  EVERYTHING else is cheap plastic  The fabric on the ceiling is almost identical to that of a Hyundai Accent  which is not a complement  At least it seems put together fairly well  It s not very comfortable  It lacks arnrests for passengers front and rear  The rear seat is very cramped for average sized males  especially in legroom  I can t complain about headroom however  At 60 mph I can t hear backseat passengers talking  the road noise is so loud  The AWD works well and its engagement is almost imperceptible  The only real problem has been that our transmission went out 26 000 miles  Fortunately it was under warranty  Overall  if you need AWD  get a Subaru legacy or Impreza  If you don t  for the money there are so many better choices  Almost any midsize car would be cheaper and better optioned  not to mention  quieter  roomier and more comfortable br br  
Camera, Olympus 146 newly introduced cutting edge Camedia C 5050 five megapixel digital camera takes the ongoing evolution of digital photography to a completely new plateau  Olympus stretched digital imaging parameters by expanding the capabilities of the standard 1 1 8 148 CCD sensor to five million pixels  Theoretically  making the pixels smaller  the only way to increase resolution without increasing CCD size  was expected to raise digital noise levels to an unacceptable level  Olympus encouraged their engineers to think outside the box and strive for increased resolution from the standard sized CCD without increasing digital noise levels were they able to accomplish this goal  Yes and no digital noise is present  as it is in all digitally generated images  but it is very well controlled  Five megapixel images place huge demands on digital camera lenses  since the optics must sharply focus a much higher resolution image where even small distortions and aberrations are magnified many times  Olympus wisely matched the proven f1 8 f2 6 35 105 zoom developed for the C3040 to their new five megapixel CCD  Add a tilting LCD monitor  ala the Canon G1 2 3 and the Nikon Coolpix 5000 and 5700  a tough magnesium alloy version of their standard  147C 148 series body  point and shoot ease of use  a full range of manual exposure options  and a wide array of creative applications and you 146ve got what may be the best prosumer digital camera ever introduced  Throw in the ability to use three different image storage formats  xD Picture Card  Smart Media  and CF types I   II and microdrives  and the creative possibilities are almost limitless The C 5050 can produce professional quality images  just set the camera to one of its manual exposure modes and compose carefully  while using the  147live 148 histogram display to adjust sharpening color saturation  and contrast  Set the white balance for the prevailing lighting and save your images as an uncompressed RAW file  If you need video clips  with audio  the C 5050 146s movie mode is limited only by the amount of memory available  If you want to maximize your creative options then you 146ll need to spend some quality time getting intimately familiar with the C 5050 146s operation  But if you just want to forget all that and be a snapshooter for an evening  or if you want your spouse to agree that you REALLY REALLY need a new five megapixel digital camera  then you can set the C 5050 to program and hand it over so they can shoot the kids birthday party without worrying about f stops and shutter speeds  but you may have some difficulty getting it back from them afterward   Viewfinder LCD  The C 5050 features a real image optical viewfinder with a diopter correction for eyeglasses wearers  The high eyepoint optical viewfinder zooms with the lens The C 5050 has a bright 1 8  tilting LCD monitor that also provides detailed information on aperture  shutter speed  image quality  and camera exposure settings  The LCD screen also provides a  live  histogram display in any automatic exposure mode  Program  Aperture  and Shutter Priority  when enabled through the LCD menu  The histogram highlights over or underexposed areas of the image  allowing photographers to fine tune exposure for correct balance of highlights and shadows  Shooters can also use the LCD screen to review saved images  and zoom in on displayed images  The  Quick View  function lets you switch quickly from shooting modes to playback mode   Top Deck LCD  The C50 146s status LCD shows major camera settings like focus mode  flash mode  drive mode  white balance  ISO  exposure compensation  and image quality without using the battery draining LCD monitor  Top deck LCD status screens are a real boon to digital photographers because they allow the battery drain from the LCD screen to be rigidly controlled by using the optical viewfinder and top deck LCD status screen rather than relying full time on the LCD monitor for exposure and status information  The C 5050 provides a very useful monochrome status LCD  but the C 5050 146s top deck status LCD isn 146t illuminated  which seems a strange omission in such a well designed prosumer digital camera   Exposure Options  Programmed Auto  Scene modes  sports  landscape  night scenes  and portrait  Aperture Priority  Shutter Priority  full manual mode  auto bracketing  exposure compensation  Optimum Image Enlargement  OIE  mode  resolution enhancement  for enlarged image size of 3200 x 2400  Olympus 146 proprietary  147TruePic 148 technology  and  My Mode  which allows users to save exposure shooting preferences for quick recall   Zoom Lens  The C 5050 features a fast 3X zoom  f1 8 2 6 35 105  all glass lens  with aspherical elements for improved sharpness and color fidelity  Users can make manual adjustments in 1 3 EV steps  This lens  first seen on the Olympus C3040  enhances the camera s low light capabilities with the fastest maximum lens aperture on any fixed lens digital camera  Under most lighting conditions  indoors and out  the lens will produce sharp  well exposed  highly  color  saturated images with resolution equal or superior to any fixed lens digital camera currently available   Macro  Olympus 146  147C 148 series cameras have always had good Macro modes and the C 5050 continues that tradition and adds a new Super Macro mode with a minimum focusing distance of 1 148inch b Ergonomics   Controls  The C 5050 146s magnesium body feels solid and professional in your hands and the new tilting LCD screen is great  especially used as a waist level or overhead finder  The control layout is logical and the C 5050 146s user interface is simple and intuitive  Menus are straightforward and access is uncomplicated  Everything is where it should be and the camera is very comfortable to handle and remarkably easy to use   Power  The C 5050 uses standard AA type batteries  4 NiMH batteries and a charger are included  I used the C 5050 for two days with a freshly charged set of batteries  more than 200 shots with heavy LCD screen and frequent flash use  and never triggered the low power warning  My friend used the camera for three days with fresh batteries and never triggered the low power warning  His shots included outdoor scenics  night shots  and macro color tests  Five days of intense use  more than 400 shots  on two sets of Olympus NiMH 1700mAh batteries  Two CR V3 lithium disposables can also be used   Flash  The C 5050 146s built in multi mode intelligent speedlight  Auto 151including automatic flash activation in low light and backlighting situations  Fill  Red eye reduction  Slow sync  and Slow synch with red eye reduction  flash is a very capable unit  The C 5050 features a hot shoe that allows an optional Olympus FL 40 flash unit to be mounted so you 146ll get not only expanded flash capabilities but also TTL flash metering and a zooming flash head as well   Image Storage Media  The C 5050 can use three different types of storage media   the new xD Picture Card  SmartMedia  and Compact Flash Type I or II  including microdrives  The C 5050 can hold two media cards simultaneously  and switch back and forth between them   Image Adjustment  Sharpness  contrast  and color saturation in   5 steps b Movies  The C 5050 can record 320X240   15fps  with

and film cameras and photographic equipment  has been trying to test as many newly introduced digital cameras as possible  which has kept the two of us pretty busy for the last month  A few weeks ago we tested the new Olympus C 4000  which has been selling like hotcakes  and ever since he 146s been trying to get Olympus 146 new five megapixel offerings  the C 50 and the C 5050  He was finally able to get the C 50 a couple of weeks ago and he got a C 5050 just before Thanksgiving  The Friday night after Thanksgiving my friend took the C 5050 down to Jefferson Square to watch the annual  147Light up Louisville 148 festivities  He wasn 146t alone  over 100 000 people turned out to see the more than 1 000 000 Christmas lights turn Louisville 146s City County administrative district into a holiday wonderland  Jefferson Street in front of the courthouse temporarily becomes Santa Claus Lane  After seeing the crowds on the TV news I was glad I chose to miss the chaos  After everything was over my friend took one look at the grid locked traffic and walked down to the foot of Fourth Street and spent half an hour shooting the Christmas Light bedecked  147Belle of Louisville 148 before finding his car and making his way home The shots of Jefferson Square were OK but nothing to write home about  The ninety year old red  white  and blue sternwheeler covered with Christmas lights was an entirely different story  The old steamboat really turned out great the C 5050 turned in completely professional looking long exposures with great colors and no noticeable noise  I was really impressed when I saw the images of the Belle on Saturday afternoon  After it got dark we took the camera for a ride through the Highlands and Cherokee Triangle neighborhoods to shoot Christmas light displays in a couple of Louisville 146s oldest and most interesting neighborhoods  We then drove down to  147Old Louisville 148 to shoot some of the hundreds of old Victorian mansions along Second  Third  and Fourth Streets  The Christmas lights in the Highlands and Old Louisville may lack some of the  147over the top 148 drama present in our suburban displays  but they really dress up the wonderful old Victorian houses  We also spent some time shooting some of the characters that make Bardstown Road come alive after dark on Saturday night  The C 5050 did an incredible job  the built in flash works very well  147in close 148 for environmental portraits of bundled up skateboarders and Goth music fans  The images  traditional Victorian mansions with Christmas lights   147woodpushers 148  and multi pierced Goths  were all very well exposed with accurate colors and no detectable noise  We got together again on Sunday morning to try some outdoor daylight shots  The weather was much better sunny and blue skies with patchy white clouds  but very cold  mid 20 146s  We bundled up and drove across the river to the Falls of the Ohio State Park  just over the Ohio River in Clarksville  Indiana  the Park is the only place where you can actually see the 380 million year old Devonian fossil beds  the exposed remains of an ancient reef  The reef used to form a short drop falls that impeded navigation on the Ohio River  It was necessary to pull boats out of the river above the falls and  147portage 148 them  and their cargoes  to a site below the falls where they could be put back in the water  The  147portage 148 made the area the perfect site for a town General George Rogers Clark built a fort on Sand Island to protect Kentucky  then a county in Virginia  and control river traffic  That primitive little fort eventually became the city of Louisville  Next year the Falls of the Ohio will be a focal point for the three year Lewis and Clark bicentennial  The expedition to explore the Louisiana Purchase commenced its journey to the Pacific from the Falls of the Ohio River  Captain Lewis joined co Captain Clark  the younger brother of Louisville 146s founder George Rogers Clark  here  Most of the Corps of Discovery party that accompanied Lewis and Clark to the Pacific were from Louisville  Kentucky and Jeffersonville  Indiana  Neither of us had been to the Falls since mid summer  We wandered around for a couple of hours taking photos with the C 5050  and freezing our butts off  Photography at the Falls is much easier in the summer when the area is filled with an explosion of green growing things  hundreds of birds  dogs  kids  hikers  and fishermen  Picture opportunities are much harder to find in early winter  We did get some nice shots of the Louisville skyline from the fossil beds and we got a couple of good images of the fossil beds with some neat oblique afternoon lighting  The Falls of the Ohio State Park is located at exit 0 on Interstate 65  North  The C 5050 did just as well in bright daylight as it had done in the dark  The AF assist light works beautifully  long exposures are a snap  no pun intended  and shutter lag  shot to shot times  and write to card times  especially if you use an xD Picture Card  are very quick b Image Quality  The C 5050 146s image quality is exceptional  easily as good or better than any five megapixel digital camera currently available  Skin tones and colors are the most accurate I have seen to date and that has a lot to do with Olympus 146 excellent image interpolation  All digital cameras use interpolation to balance colors and contrast  Olympus redesigned the C 5050 146s interpolation software to produce more accurate colors and better contrast  My friend and I printed two 8X10 inch enlargements  from full sized JPEG files  on an Epson Stylus Photo EPX785 and they were both excellent  even when inspected with a 4X Mamiya Loupe  We also printed up a couple of shots from the falls at 5X7 and both were very good with accurate well saturated colors  excellent contrast  and tack sharp resolution  Very impressive performance for the cheapest five megapixel digital camera currently available b A Few Concerns  The C 5050 146s optical viewfinder is a little tight  small  and you have to squash your nose against the LCD to use it  Olympus could have done a better job here  The C 5050 has a really aggressive sharpening function at the default setting images tend to be hard edged and a little over sharp experiment with the minus settings until you find the level that works best for you  Minus sharpening will also lower noise levels at the ISO 100 setting  There is barely visible barrel distortion at the wide angle end of the C 5050 146s zoom range but pincushion distortion at the telephoto end of the zoom appears to be very well controlled  Chromatic aberration is visible at the maximum aperture in high contrast scenes but can be easily controlled by using the histogram display to adjust contrast levels  or shoot at f4   Conclusion  Olympus is offering the C 5050 at a lower price than competing five megapixel digital cameras and that will oblige the other major manufacturers to improve their existing technology and offer new models that provide improved performance and incorporate proven components rather than introducing new technology  Competition always benefits consumers because new technology is very very expensive to develop and consumers must pay the research and development costs  In addition  new technology always comes with bugs and first generation of consumers must act as the final stage of research and development at their own expense  If your digital camera is more than one year old then there are many reasons for upgrading  There have been many significant improvements including higher resolution and newer cameras are much faster  LCD screens are sharper and brighter and not as jerky  colors are truer and white balance is much improved  Digital camera prices are the lowest they ve ever been  The Camedia C 5050 is targeted toward advanced amateur and casual pro users who want manual control and advanced features  Images from the C5050 are as good or better than the images from any 5 megapixel digital camera I have used  and in the final analysis image quality really is  147job one 148  everything else is just icing on the cake  To put a bit more of an emphasis on that statement  the C 5050 represents a real advance in the digital imaging evolution with the fastest lens  f 1 8  of any currently available digital camera  very good low light performance  lots of user input  an almost infinite variety of image adjustment options  and lots of serious image enhancing features  The C 5050 is worthy of serious consideration from anyone looking for a pro quality five megapixel imaging tool at a prosumer digi cam price  
Camera, I bought it as my first digital camera and was satisfied totally The look was great  The LCD screen size is ample The only con is that the battery drains out too soon  So have a backup set of recharge able batteries As a first time buyer of a digital camera  I did not know anything about digital cameras  When I was looking for a digital camera  my brother suggested to buy a camera with pixels between 2 and 3 mega pixels  It seems that cameras with 1 3 mega pixels are the standard for the most of digital cameras in the market  However  the quality of a picture taken by a 1 3 mega pixel camera seems slightly less than a normal picture taken by a non digital camera  So how good is 2 1 mega pixels  The real quality of pixels can be tested when a picture is enlarged  I was just amazed to see how much a 2 1 mega pixel digital picture can be enlarged without losing its clearness  A 8 X10  blow up can be printed with great results when clicked at best resolution and quality  You need to try it  The camera also comes with a 8 MB memory card and 2 5x digital zoom  I bought a 64 MB card for cheap and this stores as many photos as 600 photos at 600X480 resolution and 125 photos at the max resolution of 2 1 mega pixel As is the case for other digital cameras  the data can be easily sent by e mail to a friend or can be printed by a high level color picture printer  The included software and the U S B  link up make uploading photos to your computer a breeze  The software makes a virtual drive for the camera and can use the windows explorer to download pictures  There is a good image editing and album software included The quality of the picture printed by those high quality printers is not different  or better  from a picture taken by a non digital camera  Also  if a picture did not turn out as you intended  the picture can be erased immediately without getting printed  Considering its price  less than  150  Fine pix 2300 offers the best value for a digital camera with over 2 mega pixels  In summary  just beware of the lack of optical zoom and bad battery life  
Auto, We bought a 2003 Passat GLX Wagon to finally escape from the boredom of minivans  and be able to get 4WD and still carry a reasonable quantity of stuff for lifestyle and hobbies  After looking at the top of the line Subarus  we chose the Passat for two reasons  much tighter  solid construction  and  just as important  enough room for the toes of folks in the back seat  strangely  the Subaru leaves just minimal space  Ours is the GLX  which comes with a lot of standard stuff  including some neat gadgets  like rain sensing wipers  and our only extras are the 4WD  1 750  and Tiptronic Transmission  1 075  extras  We re glad we have both  especially the Tiptronic  which makes in traffic handling smoother and more fun in which to drive  but the rest of the standard GLX items add plenty of luxury  even the  Monsoon  radio CD tape stereo system  which has plenty of power and rich audio  and steering wheel controls  too  The GLX has a 190hp six  and that gives it plenty of performance  It handles smoothly  and visibility is terrific  The car is very comfortable in front  even though I m 6 1  and rear space is pretty good for full size  adult passengers  although it s a little tight for legroom  recent passengers on a 100 mile trip have said it was fine  however  and heck  we ride in front anyhow  On the GLX model  the rear cargo area comes with a  roller shade  cover  which we like  and the cargo deck is fitted with nice carpeting with strips to support heavy items  These look nice  but the carpet and strips combine to be a little slippery  and there s no standard cargo net for grocery bags  an inconvenience  We ve ordered a rubber pad for the area to provide better cargo security  More news follows on this  a minor inconvenience  There are lots of cubbies and storage  and VW does one thing  as does Audi  that emphasizes their user friendly emphasis  They even provide a specially little hidey hole for the owner s manual  All together  this is a remarkable compact car that is virtually completely satisfactory  And  it had ZERO DEFECTS  Perfect as it came  And still fine after over 1000 miles   The above was written in October  2002  when we had about 1000 miles on the car  Now  April 2003  after 5 000  we have confirmed the quality of the vehicle  still nice and taught but fuel mileage is a real concern  we ve gotten  at best  a little over 20mpg when doing real highway driving  clearly not where it should be  sticker showed 19 city  26 highway  Our dealer is following up with VW  more news follows  If you live in the Northwest as we do  the 4WD makes it a good ski and mountain traveler  too  
Camera, I started looking for a digital camera early this summer  and after looking at several in the store and reading several epinions  I chose the Canon PowerShot S10  Highest rated on Epinions  which i use for all of my shopping information on what and more importantly where to buy It was a great choice In the last 6 mos I have taken over 200 great pictures  which more than I took over the last 10 years before I had the Canon PowerShot S10  This camera is lightweight  small and easy to use  It is even semi water resistant  A few weekends ago on a camping trip I fell into the river in the excitement of my boyfriend catching a huge fish  and the camera somehow survived being fully submerged into the water  It still works perfectly  and I even managed to salvage the pictures I had taken before the face plant The only piece of criticism I have for this camera is that the battery life is very short   always have a few charged backup batteries on hand when you take this camera out Otherwise  it is a great investment and I concur with everyone else on Epinions who has reccommended it as a great purchase  I bought mine on Buy com for about  400  but I am sure you can get it cheaper now  Epinions will show you where to get the best deal  
Auto, We bought this car for my wife to use for the next 8 years as our family grew  Initially  everything seemed to run smoothly and we were pleased with the cars performance  Within the past year though  the car started to shudder when braking  Also  the brakes seem to catch when applying a small amount of pressure  This gives the passengers in the car the feeling that the driver is really stepping hard on the brakes  There is one other  quot problem quot  that does not sit well with me in regards to this car  When driving on the interstate the RPM s are well into the 3500 to 4000 s at 70 mph  In comparison  the Nissan Altima we own had no problem doing 90 mph at just over 3000 RPM s  The car has plenty of pick up for acceleration and handles well when driven  We haven t been disappointed with the car but are not overly enthusiastic about the car either     
Auto, The Plymouth Neons are nice cars for the money  They give a great ride and are comfortable  They have a lot of room inside  We own one and have three children  One with a car seat  one with a booster seat  and one that uses the seat belt and there is still room to spare  My kids have never complained about being cramped  The engines are also great on gas and are dependable if taken care of  Body style is eye catching  Our car is used  1995  have had it for almost one year and have had it in the shop once  Nothing serious or expensive  Easy to heat for those in cold climates  We actually get too warm while traveling  I recommend this car for families as well as single people br br  
Camera, Well pooey  Someone has written almost exactly the review I would have  I absolutely love the 780c  I have not bought any of the extras like rechargeable batteries or an adapter card YET  A friend who sells digital cameras kind of scoffed at me wanting to purchase this camera until he saw the quality of a picture taken  I rarely even use the highest resolution and get some of the most detailed clear pictures much better than even my 35mm camera  I find it very easy to use  and once you get the hang of the photo program it is a cinch  Occasionally I find that I need to go in and fix up a picture usually to make it a bit lighter I have poor lighting in my house  But the results when you do that are even good  only takes some of the sharpness out of the picture  I really would recommend someone buying this camera  My mom loves receiving pictures I have printed on photo paper in the snail mail and I love not having to pay for the developing only to get a few good shots  My husband loves that he can delete a photo that didn t come out right hehe br br  
Auto, The S2000  It s flashy and it s fast  but it s never really fit into any category  If you re looking for something fast and powerful  you look towards Porsche and Audi  If you want a family car  you head towards Honda and Volvo  I would have thought that Honda s changes for the better would have formed the S2000 into a more economy type car  Instead they have taken all the practability out of it  jazzed up it s look  and made it a lot more fun  I test drived the S2000 at my local dealer  although I never really considered purchasing  I was definitely impressed  It was light and fast  and it seemed as though the handling fit like a glove  I was making turns at 45 without a bit of hesitation  and you could really feel the strength that went through the Honda  It does have a few problems though  And actually  Honda has make it a bit awkward to drive  The console  This is a quite important piece of the car  as it tells you some information vital to driving a car  Honda took it and turned it into a video game  They re seemed to be charts and graphs and features and whatever else they could think of to make it look goofy  It hurt your head just looking at it  I have heard that a lot of the more recent releases were equipped with standard consoles  and if you find one like that  it s gonna be a lot more easier on you than the one I test drove  Now for the family man  This is a nice looking car  but merely a toy  There is no possible way you could use this for a family  as it has only two seats  duh  and basically no storage room  I mean none  The trunk is small  and I m really not even sure if it fits a spare tire  Even the glove compartment has been shrunken down  as it now folds out vertically  Although it looks like everything would fall out of it  it does work alright  Yet  I d definitely rather have a standard glove compartment  Just like the console  this is one of Honda s other  fun little gizmos  Gas mileage isn t that bad for a family car  but simply ranks up with other sports cars  The dealer said it could get 26 miles to the gallon  but I d really say it s more like 22  If you wanted a practical car  turn around right now  The game s up on the S2000  Price  Well  I m not really sure if it s good or bad  Since I don t know if I m judging a sports car or an economy car  I ll just say that it costs about  33k  but the dealers are getting up for  29k  If you get it through to them that you know how much their paying  a lot of dealers will give you the car for 30k and change  For a sports car 33 thousand isn t bad  but it s no Porsche  But the S2000 does have 240 horses  so I d say that for 30k  you re getting a pretty good deal   Once again  you re buying a toy  This is the kind of decision you d really want to think over before plunking down the cash  At the rate they re going right now  in a year you should be able to get one used for 15 or 16k  Then again  it would be used My conclusion is good for this car  If you want a snappy sports car with a fairly good price and mediocre gas mileage  you ve found your car  It looks good on the road for all you chick magnets and it comes in quite a variety of colors  There s a new blue color  but I still prefer the black  You ll be getting a much better value if you can work your dealer down to  30k  and if you buy one now remember that it ll probably have the  video game  console and the annoying glove compartment  You could surely get those things changed  but then you d be putting more money down  and once you re talking in the  40k range  the S2000 s simply overpriced  Look over the options before you buy and test drive  If you test drive it first  you might just simply fall in love This is my first review  so leave me a comment  If you have any questions about the review  the car  or anything in general  feel free to contact me at pavshow aol com  Thank you for reading my first review  as I m going to need encouragement to think it s actually good    
Camera, The DC Zoom Camera by Kodak is definitely a professional camera  and really gives a professional performance  but it s not for everyone  The features are impressive  but so is the price  It has a 3x optical zoom plus a 2x digital zoom for a focal length equivalent to 38mm wide angle to 115mm zoom It has a 1 6 million pixel resolution 1536 x 1024  and a 2 0 quot  TFT color LCD for review and preview  plus an optical viewfinder  There are four flash modes to choose from  and an optional external flash sync enabled  and it includes the 16MB Kodak picture card  It s fully compatible with Windows 95  98  NT 4 0  and Power Macintosh  Mac0S 7 6 or later  It also has automatic OR manual exposure with automatic white balance  This equipment really delivers  but it s not for the faint hearted it s a 950  model  geared towards someone that is very familiar with digital technology  If you re a novice do NOT start here  If not  go for it you will be amazed with the quality br br  
Auto, The Chrysler Corp  seems to be struggling a bit  It s not for a lack of good products  certainly Dodge trucks have etched themselves on our collective consciousness as tough and durable alternatives to Chevy or Ford  And the Dodge Viper consistently makes the top ten where performance is concerned  The Jeep Liberty is a ten fold improvement over the Cherokee it replaces  But what about the sedans   names like Sebring  Stratus  Intrepid  and Concorde don t seem to ring any bells with many consumers  Again  not for a lack of good products   those cars are all fine choices  but seem to suffer from an anonymity of sorts A perfect case in point is the Chrysler 300M  Typically  Chryslers have been more about luxury than performance  The 300M seeks to blend the two in keeping with the heritage of Chrysler s  letter cars  of the 50s and 60s  Granted  the number 300 used to be an indication of horsepower  but times change  Chrysler s latest 300  the 300M  is an attractive and well balanced performance sedan similar in execution to an Acura or Infinity  The problem with Chrysler is that no Acura or Infinity customers seem to be cross shopping the 300M with the I35 or TL  There s no GOOD reason for this  other than the fact that the name  Chrysler  lacks the name recognition or panache of an Acura  Infinity  or even Lexus  Lets face it  when a consumer hears the name  Acura  they are not confused with thoughts of minivans or mid priced convertibles  The name Acura means a few  specific things   luxury combined with performance and reliability  Chrysler should do the same  Give all the minivans and mid priced sedans and convertibles to Dodge  and let Chrysler stand as a premium brand that balances performance and luxury Global product strategy aside  the 300M is quite a capable car  It does  in fact  blend performance and luxury  and does it very well  Inside the 300M are nice  little touches of class such as the white faced gauges with chrome rings around them  an analog clock with the same chrome treatment  and a beautiful wood an leather steering wheel  Although the steering wheel has many cruise control buttons  they do not light up at night  forcing the driver to take his her eyes off the road for just a second  The instrument cluster glows in a backlit neon bluish tint that feels both modern and retro at the same time  The luxury side of this car is obvious  Leather seats are soft  but the leather lacks the quality feel of a Cadillac  Lexus or even a Toyota  Two person memory sets not only the seats  but mirrors  and radio stations as well  including the steering wheel in the memory settings would be even better  Rear seat leg room is excellent  rivaling even the much larger Cadillac Deville  head room is also excellent  Climate control buttons are simple  straightforward and easy to reach  Audio controls are a little more confusing and seem to lack the ergonomic thoughtfulness found on many Japanese cars  but an in dash CD changer is a welcome feature on any car  Overall the dash is well laid out  and conveys a simple elegance  The main detractor inside the 300M is the overuse of cheap looking and feeling plastic  While much of the interior has a quality feel  much of the dash and console area seem cheap by comparison  On the road  the 300M lives up to its performance heritage with firm suspension and plenty of power  Sure  a 300M should have 300 hp  but 250 is plenty  The 300M is powered by a 3 5 liter V6  and while 250 hp is  in fact plenty  this car lacks the all out grunt of the MUCH more expensive Cadillac Seville STS  Still  acceleration is brisk  and the engine has a pleasing growl even under hard stomps on the gas  The Chrysler s V6 also has a sporty exhaust note  something that is noticeably lacking on other sport luxury sedans such as the DeVille DTS  Lexus GS  and Infinity I35  Hard cornering is nothing short of fun in the 300M  and while it s easy to make horsepower comparisons to Cadillacs costing  10 20 000 more  the 300M will out handle most any sedan with the possible exception of an Audi or BMW  Comparing an Audi to a Chrysler  Surely the grumbling has begun  but the 300M isn t just an appearance package  it s really a stiff and sporty car  When pressed hard  the nose has a tendency to push in the corners  but such is the nature of front wheel drive cars  Remember  this is a car that can make spirited driving a blast  but still carry 5 adults comfortably  There is a slight price to pay for the 300M s agile cornering ability  On rough roads  the 300M s ride seems a bit harsh  lacking the softness of an Acura or Lexus  However both Acura and Lexus sedans are prone to much more body roll than the 300  Continuing the sport theme is Chrysler s Autostick  auto manual transmission  This shift it yourself automatic is one of more responsive systems of any car that is so equipped  with the possible exception of Porsche  Once the Autostick mode has been selected  the shifting is precise and quick  The shift lever itself has a quality feel  with virtually no excess  play  right to left  The only drawback to the Autostick is the clunkiness with which it slides into the Autostick gate  there is a bit of a catch when going back and forth between full automatic and Autostick that is slightly unnerving  To enter Autostick mode  the driver must shift into one extra notch below the  D  for drive  then move the lever right or left to move up or down a gear  In other auto manual equipped cars such as the Kia Optima  the shift it yourself mode is entered by sliding the shifter to the right  then moving the lever up or down to select a higher or lower gear  The type of system used in the Kia is much more intuitive   this is a minor point at best  and most drivers will quickly adapt to the Chrysler system with no complaint Overall the 300M is an under appreciated sport sedan that is worth considering when shopping for other sporty sedans  BMW owners will likely not be swayed  but anyone considering a Lexus  Jaguar  Acura or Infinity owes it to themselves to test drive a 300M  The handling prowess will bring a smile to your face   it is an incredibly tight car  Even though the interior is not up to Lexus standards in terms of quality and comfort  it does have an elegance that is lacking in other American cars   even the DeVille s interior seems bland by comparison  The 300M s few shortcomings can be boiled down to just three  1  too much road noise 2  some cheap interior pieces 3  no lights on the steering wheel mounted controls  All told  the 300M is a good looking  roomy  somewhat affordable  sport sedan that offers a lot of sport with a little luxury  Base price for the 300M is around  29 000  That does not include such extras as a sunroof or chrome wheels  The standard 300M is all you need to fulfill the sporting urge  but still retain the practicality of an everyday car  
Camera, I m what some would call a professional artist  I ve worked as a photographer as well as a graphic artist  Because of this  I like to think that I have a pretty good knowledge of what looks good  and I must tell you that you can get some great pics out of this little guy I say little in a figurative sense  this camera is a tad on the big heavy side  I m used to full sized working with 35mm SLR cameras  TLR 120 cameras and even 4x5 large format cameras  so I m not too picky when it comes to lugging a camera around  The Kodak DC240 is not cumbersome in any way  it is simply a little larger than I would have hoped  There are smaller digital cameras on the market  but they don t yield the same image quality and features  so a slightly larger size is an acceptable tradeoff  for me Next  we come to the image size  resolution  offered  I ve found that for the majority of my uses  the Kodak has actually given me MORE than I end up using  On the average  600x450 is about the size I use when sending pictures to family and friends  so 1280x960 is more than adequate  It allows me to do something that you can t really do when limited to 640x480   Crop and scale  with some room to breathe   The optical zoom comes in handy quite frequently  and I find the option of 2 different light metering modes  center weighted and  multi pattern  to be quite generous  White balance and exposure compensation round out the suite of  photo  options  Kodak goes beyond this and includes in camera effects  which can be quite fun  as well as user definable borders  This is especially useful when you are connecting the camera through the included video adapter cable  I was extremely impressed with the quality of the video output from this little camera  it can be useful for reviewing the contents of the memory card when a camera is not available  I really liked the driver software included with the camera  it allows your camera to be seen through Windows98 Explorer  as if it were a Hard Drive or Zip Disk  just no drive letter  and enables you to simply drag and drop the picture you want off of your camera  I found the USB connection speed to be just a little too slow  though it s dramatically faster than some others I ve seen  Now for the little things that I m not totally happy with The camera offers decent battery life when the LCD and flash are not being used  though it can run through the batteries before you even fill up your memory card with both enabled  I ve noticed that the pictures come out a little too saturated at times  and a little too bright at others  so a little tweaking with the photoshop ish program of your choice may be in order to get the best results  In general though  the images don t NEED to be retouched  it s just a matter of personal preference  Kodak doesn t seem to have included a method to reset the picture count  the pictures are named in sequence  to my knowledge  and I would really like to see some facility for that  The only serious flaw I ve found in this camera is occasional lockups in the camera itself  I haven t found any mention of this on the Kodak website  and I haven t seen any firmware updates to address the problem either  Regardless  the problem is very infrequent  All in all I d recommend the camera to anyone looking to get into digital photography or just looking for something with a quicker cheaper turnaround than a 1hour photolab  This camera is perfect for families and small business offices  but nothing beyond that  Film is still the best way to go for real graphics work  and I doubt that digital will be able to completely displace it for quite a while br br  
Auto, I bought a used 1995 Dodge Intrepid in 1996  I paid  12 500  I compared the Intrepid to the Ford Taurus  and learned that the Intrepid has more interior space  for less money  That summer 5 adults took a 2 week road trip in the Intrepid  We spent a good deal of our trip in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado   Rocky Mt  National Park actually  The car ran flawlessly at high altitude  The Intrepid does well in city traffic such as Denver  The 5 of us were able to still talk to each other at the end of our road trip  All of us commented how the Intrepid made our lengthy road trip fun  and comfortable  I spent some time as a passenger  and I can say I enjoyed the huge backseat  We have the smaller engine  and in Montana s  quot Autobahn quot  I 90  we had no trouble keeping up with all the other 90 mph traffic  The only little mechanical glinch we ve experienced is the odd cigarette lighter that somehow blows fuses that operate the horn  Nobody in our family smokes  or uses the lighter  the wiring is just a bit off  We got rid of the lighter  amp  the problem  We consistently get mileage in the 25 mph range  The car has plenty of space  power  and  quot creature comforts quot  It has over 75K miles now  I change the oil at 3000 miles  There is a tiny bit of road noise at speed  But for the money  the car is a good touring rig  We plan to keep this car for some time     
Auto, Let me say it from the outset  I love Volvo station wagons  This is my third Volvo wagon  but my first new car ever  of any sort My husband Bob and I bought our 2000 V70 in August 2000  We didn t intend to buy a car just then  We d attended a Volvo station wagon test drive event in mid July  and became acquainted with the new Volvos and what they have to offer  We loved the test drive but thought we were years away from buying another car  So we ate Swedish meatballs  enjoyed the various performances  and used our free tickets to the Liberty Science Center from Volvo  the science center parking lot was the location of the event Less than a month later  our mechanic declared our 1984 BMW not worth repairing  Our other car  which was our  quot newer quot  car  is a 1987 Volvo 240 wagon that we bought used in 1995  We narrowed our choices to three  1  buy Bob s father s 1990 Honda Civic  2 search out another used Volvo wagon  3 buy a new minivan  preferably a Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey  Dutifully  we did some online research  searched the classified ads and poked around on local dealers  lots  Resigned that our best option was another used wagon  we headed to Red Bank Volvo At Red Bank Volvo we found several perfectly nice used wagons  We also looked enviously at the 2001 wagons that had just arrived  What we didn t count on was our discovery of five 2000 V70s for sale  The cars had been used as service loaners  In an effort to snag the attention of people who already owned Volvos and would possibly be in the market for another in the future  these wagons were loaded with nice options  All had sunroofs  leather interiors and winter packages  Each had 3000 5000 miles on the odometer and came with a new car warranty This added a wrinkle to our decision making  Here was a car that was all we ever dared dream of in a station wagon  and at  29 000  it was several thousand dollars less than a 2001 would be  On the other hand  if we were willing to spend that much  why not just go for the gusto and get a 2001  In fact  we thought  why not really go for it and take European delivery  Then we d get the car and a nice trip for about the price of a 2001 We came back to our senses and decided that the best deal for us was one of the 2000 V70 loaners  There were two green ones  two blue ones and a black one available on our first visit  By the time we went back a day or two later to choose a car  both green and the black one were still available  but one of the blue ones had been sold  We took another good look at the remaining four and chose the blue one The car has been nothing short of thrilling for me  It is so  of course  in the quiet  elegant way a Volvo would be thrilling  The car handles easily  smoothly and well  Pick up is good  and the car s interior is virtually soundproofed from outside noise and engine sounds  This is our first car with a CD player and we are enjoying it a lot  The audio quality is excellent  Our car has an automatic sunroof that we use almost daily  either fully open  or as a moonroof  The car is equipped with an optional winter package  but luckily it hasn t been cold enough in NJ yet for us to have used it The car s steering is responsive but firm  I like the way the brakes handle  it makes me feel as in control of a car as I ever have been  The dashboard controls and indicators are clearly marked and easy to use  Our car has an optional feature knob called  quot info quot  near the trip odometer  The knob can be adjusted to display various pieces of information  such as outdoor temperature  actual miles per gallon  average miles per gallon for the trip  or the number of miles until refueling is necessary  Seating in the car is considerably more roomy than our 240 wagon  There is more driver leg room  and the car has an overall feeling of being wider than the 240  The back seat comfortably seats two adults and a child  It might even be OK for three adults to sit across for a trip that isn t too long  The back seat also features a built in booster seat that our seven year old and her friends fight to sit in  which is not usually the case with a booster seat and children their age  The driver s seat features three memory settings so that all I have to do is push the number 1 setting on the seat base and the seat bottom and back will automatically move to the position I have chosen We have had the optional third seat installed  at an additional cost of about  1 200  This seat can hold two children weighing up to 80 pounds each  The addition of this seat means that we can have up to seven people in the car  2 adults in the front  three children in the back and two children in the third seat  Knowing that we could add this seating capacity eased our anxiety about foregoing the carrying capacity of a minivan     
Auto, I had just started a new job  I m in Sales  and I need a car that would be reliable and something I could feel good about owning  My first new car was a 1994 Chevy Cavalier  which I never regretted buying because of both it s appearance and performance  I wanted to do the same with this car  My wife s family swears by Honda and I have always been impressed when I see older Hondas that still look sharp and not outdated  Honda also has a good reputation for durability  We originally were looking at Honda Civic to fit in with my newlywed  new job budget  However  they were trying to unload the 2002 Accords to get the 2003 s in  read  excuse to tell you that you are getting a good price on the car  so we went with the Accord  The reason that we chose the Special Edition was because my wife really liked the model  It is a sharp looking car  We got the black coupe  without the  flap   spoiler  I am proud to own it from that standpoint  And we did get a good deal  The Special Edition gives you  Aluminum Rims  AM FM Cassette CD stereo w  6 speakers  adjustable seats raise and lower  moon roof and cruise control Performance has given me mixed feelings  I do drive the car alot  14 000 miles in 6 months  It doesn t have alot of power  Take off speed is often slow  especially if the car hasn t had a chance to warm up  Going up hills is a big concern for me because I live in a hilly town  I got stuck on my first hill here in the winter  I started from a dead stop on an upgrade and barely made it up  I never had any problems like that before  I never thought I was getting a race car  but I expected a little more than that The windows fog at every given opportunity as well  What is even more strange is using the air conditioner over the heater gets rid of it quicker  The stereo is top notch  I was ready to replace it right off the bat  but it can be loud if you need it loud and the sound is good with the six speaker system Another good feature is the inability to lock your keys in the car  If the keys are in the ignition  and you hit lock on the car either by manually pressing the lock stick down or the all lock button  and you shut the door  it will automatically unlock Overall the car is nice  but I think I paid too much for it  even at 18 000  The real test will be after I have hit 100 000 miles and what the car looks like then  
Auto, I ve now had my 2002 Aerio for 15 000 miles  and can bring to you a review with some experience behind it The Pros The Aerio is definitely inexpensive compared with other similar cars out there  Standard  the Aerio has Cruise Control  Air Conditioning  Power Windows  Power Mirror Adjustment  In Dash CD Player  Foglamps and a Trunk Organizer that is just fabulous  I looked at several other similarly priced featured models  and found them to be underfeatured or overpriced compared to the Aerio every time  I was particularly shocked with the Ford Focus Wagon  which I felt was a terrible value  it rattled and creaked while driving  was underpowered and poorly designed and Ford had few incentives to buy  On the other hand  the Mazda Protege 5 is a wonderful car with good features  but comprably equipped it is much more expensive than the Aerio  I believe the Aerio is a great value The Aerio has a lot of room and is a very easy car to live with  The seats are comfortable in front and back  and my Basketball playing  6 7ft tall  friends have commended it on the ample backseat leg and headroom  The rear seats both fold down for transporting stuff  and can be adjusted back in three positions  from nearly erect to a slightly reclined position  for the comfort of your passengers  The rear seats have a fold down armrest with a cup holder  which my passengers like  For storage  the Aerio has a large glove compartment  a drawer under the front passenger seat  shallow door pockets in front  three cupholders in the console  two in front  one in back  magazine pockets on the back of the front seats  a pocket in the very back  and one of my favorite features  a multi compartment storage area under the rear deck that includes an integrated bucket  You know all that stuff that seems to build up in your trunk  You can store it in here  making for a neater car and keeping it handy at the same time  With the seats folded down for stowing  I have been surprised at what will fit in back  I have fit a 32  TV  in box  a full size Whirlpool clothes Dryer  not to mention several tables and other stuff  Short of an SUV or Pickup  the Aerio has a lot of space for the price The Aerio is an economical car to drive  Powered by a 141 hp  2 0 liter  inline 4  the Aerio gets about 26 MPG in the city and 33 MPG on the highway  I ve found that it s important to keep an eye on the Aerio s tire pressure or these numbers plummet fast  The Aerio comes backed with an excellent warranty as well  and the success of the car ensures plentiful parts for years to come  The Aerio is fun to drive  I d describe the engine as  peppy  in that I  leadfoot  rarely feel like my need for speed is being denied  When needing extra juice for a high speed merge or pass  a tromp on the gas is all it takes and the Aerio takes off with aplomb  When the A C is running  the pep is a little more restrained  but not too much  Ride is better than I would expect from a car this economical  but it s not perfect  There is road  tire and engine noise present at all speeds  but not to the point that it is bothersome  in my opinion  If you are looking for a dead quiet ride  I recommend Mercedes  D  The handling is not sports car quality  either  but predictable and reliably solid  The turning radius is quite tight  making for easy quick parking  u turns and other maneuvers  Seat comfort is good  I ve driven it 10 hours nonstop without causing much soreness or bother  The dashboard of the Aerio might take a little getting used to  but it makes sense  The digital readout is a little strange but is completely functional and well designed  The Heating AC switches are easy to understand  as is the stereo  windshield wiper and cruise controls  The A C  when running full blast  is COLD  I strongly suspect an 8 year old could drive the Aerio  it s that simple  The Neutrals Much has been said about the Aerio s look  Some say it s ugly  Some say it s wierd  I say it looks just fine for me The Cons As mentioned above  the Aerio is not the most insular of rides  Bad roads will be felt and heard while driving  just as good roads make for a very pleasant ride  Suzuki makes a  100 center console armrest for the Aerio  I believe this should come included as it would increase driving comfort significantly A pet peeve of mine is that the A C always runs when the front defog defroster is on  While this makes it work very well  I would have preferred to have the choice of running the defog defrost and A C together rather than having them linked  The rear tray that covers the luggage area is a little flimsy  I no longer use it at all  but this is because when I did  it became clear that taking it out and replacing it often would probably lead to its breaking in the near future When I be jammin  to loud music  the door speakers can sometimes vibrate  causing a buzzing noise  Otherwise  the stereo is great  and I ve discovered that the buzzing stops if one cracks each window a centimeter or so The mesh used on the seats and doors seems to hold soil more than other fabrics  But  all in all  after my first 15 000 miles  I can make the following conclusions    I love my Aerio   I drive my Aerio whenever I can  my wife hardly drives anymore    The Aerio is an excellent value    The Aerio is versatile   great for moving stuff  road trips  and passengers    The Aerio is FUN  
Camera, I run the National Center for Child Safety in Tennessee  and I bought this camera to use in schools and daycares in order to create ID cards for children  This entails literally thousands of pictures per month  I purchased the FD 90 because it had the desired picture quality that I was looking for  For the purpose of child IDs  this camera is perfect  It is durable and the photo quality of a small driver s license type photo is incredible  However  I am not completely comfortable using this camera as the conventional family camera  capturing special moments and saving vacation memories forever  Why  Several reasons  First of all  most people would want to take special photos on the highest resolution  While the highest resolution setting will take pictures that look rather stunning on your computer screen  printing them is another story  A suitable printer that is capable of printing the picture at a quality you would want to keep would cost several hundred dollars  Furthermore  at the highest resolution  the FD 90 will only take 3 5 pictures per floppy disk  This means that if you are away from your vacation cottage for a day  you ll have to lug around at least 5 disks if you want to take 25 pictures  You can purchase a  quot memory stick quot  that will store about 60 70 pictures  but this is a very pricey option  all things considered  it will run you about  150 or more  Not an easy task if you are trying to travel light not to mention the size and considerable bulk of the camera itself  However  if you are absolutely convinced that you want to go digital  I would suggest this camera over any other that I ve tried in my business which includes most in the Sony Mavica line  It can do incredible things to photos by virtue of its myriad picture effects and shutter speed settings  Charging the battery is easy and relatively quick a completely run down battery can be recharged in as little as 2 hours  If you buy this or any other digital camera with the intent of editing and printing many pictures  I would suggest that you invest in a good picture editing software  Don t be fooled by the MPEG movie feature  The resolution is low  and it generally only takes about 15 seconds of footage  In other words  don t invest in this camera if you are thinking it can be both your still and motion camera br br  
Auto, I was 23 years old when I bought my red 1994 Dodge Viper RT 10 and the smile hasn t left my face since  It s the type of car that when you park  as you walk away you look back and think  quot is that really my car quot  or  quot nothing can be this wildly beautiful quot  Owning a Viper is unlike owning any other car  Strangers stop and stare  honk their horns  take pictures  women proposition you  I am male  cops follow you and your heartbeat never comes back down  The power  sound and looks are absolutely ridiculous Driving the car requires respect for the power that it possesses  This car can not be thrown around the way less powerful sports cars  RX 7  Corvettes  Supra Turbo  etc  can  It is much less forgiving for driver transgressions and does not have ABS  To get the most out of it  and to truly feel comfortable at the wheel  I suggest professional driving racing lessons  as I intend to take  On the negative side  I have had to make several trips to the shop to get the car looked at worked on  The problem is that you need the dealership to have a Viper technician which limits your choices  Also  oil changes are expensive as it takes 10 qts of Mobil 1 Overall  if you are looking for a car that s easy to drive to zip around town in  this is NOT it  If you are looking for a beast that will intimidate you  challenge you  envelop you and blow you away  this is the ONLY one br br  
Auto, My first three cars were Toyota Corollas  Then I decided to try something different   a Subaru XT  Although I enjoyed it and had it for about 9 years  it didn t come without problems  I decided to go back with a Toyota   but which one  I had occasionally seen an MR2 on the road but was certain that it would be out of my price range   even a  91 had to be at least  12 000  I m talking 1997 here  I happened to take a look at an MR2 ad in the paper and  to my surprise  the price was REASONABLE  They were between  6500 and  10 000  Well  I decided that I had to think no further   my next car would be an MR2  Looked at many and finally  and  again  to my surprise  found the best one at a car dealer  non Toyota Well  the MR2 has been car I ve ever owned  I absolutely love it It drives like a dream  It is VERY comfortable  I have had NO mechanical problems with it  The only problems I ve had are minor   the headlights seem to need to be replaced like once every 1 2 years  or is this normal    I thought headlight life was more like 3 4 years  Also  I believe the previous owner did something to the panel above the passenger side floorboard and now when I go really fast air rushing in makes the panel flutter  A not very good mechanic tried fixing it   I m in the process of finding someone who can This is a car that  for a Toyota  gets AMAZING comments  The model is 1991  but people think it is a fairly new car   I guess I keep it in good shape  although need to wash more often  I live in Vegas and the hotel valets frequently say  cool wheels  Co workers that see my car for the first time are like   wow   you can afford THAT  With the fact that the car is just a GOOD CAR  getting these extra comments are like icing on the cake Update 2 24 01  In reading some of the other opinions on MR2  I wanted to specify that my model is non turbo  non T top  automatic  I investigated all model variations when I was in the market to buy and was told upon more than one occasion that the turbo model could be problematic  and that the T Tops could have leakage and safety problems  That is not to say that ALL turbos or ALL T tops will have problems  I have  too  read opinions from people who have those features and have no problems  However  I would recommend that buyers carefully research the reliability and maintenance history of the turbo systems and or T tops when considering a purchase  I was originally going to buy a 5 speed  but of all the models I found the one with the best overall record  functionability and appearance happened to be an automatic  so I bought it  The car just turned 85 000 miles  and I ve had it since 50k  Up to this point  haven t had one problem  excepting the very minor ones above  
Camera, I researched numerous digital cameras and finally made a decision to purchase the Hewlett Packard C200  What a pleasant surprise  I found this camera to be very well made and it was also well balanced  The instruction manual was very clear and well written  In less than fifteen minutes I was using this camera and all of it s many features  The photo quality was at least twice as good as I ever expected from this rice range from a digital camera  I found it very easy to download into my computer  The software included with the camera is very simple to operate and to the point  This is probably the BEST buy and BEST camera for the money  You can t go wrong owning this camera br br  
Auto, The Chevrolet Suburban is the best all around value in the competitive SUV market  I have a wife and 4 kids  Three of them are teenagers  The Suburban has never had any trouble storing any of our families equipment  It has nearly the same amount of storage as a full size van  The Suburban has one of the most powerful engines of all SUV S  It also tows better than all other SUV s  Our family prefers The Chevrolet Suburban over all SUV s because it can hold all the equipment of a full size van and still handle and out perform other SUV s  The Suburban has been a very popular model for Chevrolet  Most dealerships are eager to work on them and perform regular maintanence exams  Those are all excellent reasons why my family prefers the Chevrolet Suburban over all other SUV s     
Camera, Are you one of those people who purchased a webcam or a digital camera five years ago and considered yourself a leader  Have you upgraded that purchase since then  If not  you might be surprised to find what is out there and the functions that have been added to make the webcam experience and the digital camera experience more fun My fiance has long pushed me to purchase an  inexpensive  digital camera  One that we could on vacations or to the shore and not worry about it every second of the trip  yet one that still took decent photos  Sure  you can try the throw away digital cameras  but the photo quality is still lacking  Hence  the smile on my face when I came upon the Logitech Clicksmart 420  solid digital camera that will not break the bank THE SPECIFICS  Up to 1 3 megapixel pictures  8 megabytes internal flash memory  Storage for over 80 pictures and 70 seconds of video  Video capture resolution of 320 x 240 as a digital camera  Video capture resolution of 640 x 480 pixels as a webcam  Built in microphone and tripod options  Picture formats include jpeg and avi  Four AAA batteries  One touch flash  delete  and timer functions  Wrist strap and lens cover There are other specifics that are more important to the serious photographer  but I did not list them  The reason is that this is a not a digital camera for the serious photographer  The 420 is a solid digital camera that is probably not going to be the best camera that you own WHAT I LIKE 1  Ease of use  The 420 is almost all one touch  You can delete pictures with one touch and set the flash and timer functions with just a touch  You can also take a photo and send an email with just a single touch  Heck  downloading the software is just a few steps more than a single touch  Anyone can learn and use this in a short period of time 2  The price quality debate  Like I mentioned  this is not a great camera  but for the price I would argue that it is pretty good  The photos and options are not going to be as good as what you get with your  1 000 00 digital camera  but they will be fairly good  From time to time I will find that I get a photo that is not of great quality  So what  With a digital camera you simply delete it and try again  Considering that you are paying less than  100 for the 420  I think you will agree that the quality is pretty good 3  The ability to send photos over the internet  This has always been one of the more annoying aspects of the digital camera for me  I purchased my parents a  800 digital camera last Christmas and we still struggle with the picture sharing function  The 420 makes things fairly easy  You have the USB cable and the docking station and then the software  Then you simply take a photo or video as you would normally and save it  Finally  you put the camera in the docking station and select the picture or video you want to email and click the send button  That is it and the beauty of it is that it works  You can also send to a Mac or a PC 4  The durability  Ok  this is the reason we bought the 420  The 420 has rounded edges that make a drop less painful and a rubber and plastic casing that make the drop harmless  The pieces are put together well enough that you can drop the camera on the beach and not suffer from sand ruining things  Now let me back up a second and mention that we have not tried these things  but you can feel the tautness of the design and the durability that the rubber provides  5  We are not there yet  but a great camera for kids  First of all  the durability mentioned above makes the 420 a nice camera for kids  Secondly  the rounded edges mean less likelyhood of a nasty fall  Thirdly  the large buttons provide for ease of use  Finally  the one touch operation makes the 420 easy to learn  Hence  the 420 is truly a good camera for a child 6  The dual function of webcam digital camera  I do not use the webcam function all that often  but when I do I like a webcam that I can depend on  Oftentimes this will depend on what service you are using  AOL  MSN  Yahoo  Etc  but it also often depends on the webcam itself  The 420 works with all the major IM platforms and provides video and audio options along with the standard chat  The webcam option provides a clear picture on both ends of the spectrum  a big change  No longer are you stuck with a webcam that needs a bright light in order for the other person to see you  Hallelujah and again the webcam function is very easy to use 7  The memory is pretty good  You can save 80 pictures without downloading and that is more than I will ever have on a camera at a single time  Remember  if you do not like a photo you can delete it  Finding 80 pictures that you like  from say a single trip  is a lot  The same goes for the 70 seconds of video  While this is not a lot of time  it is enough to capture a video of something unexpected or special that you otherwise would have missed  8  Customer service  I am not sure that is the right term for what I mean  but it will have to work  Logitech has always provided me with a good customer service option  the people people know what they are talking about and the wait is usually not too long  I also find that the two year product guarantee is a nice touch  I doubt I will need to use the customer service line or the guarantee  but it is nice to know that both are available and useful WHAT I DO NOT LIKE 1  The batteries  The 420 runs on four AAA batteries  You can take a decent amount of pictures  but the video function is going to drain the battery quickly  Aside from keeping the cost down  I am not sure why Logitech did not go ahead and utilize a better battery  2  The memory is  pretty  good  Aside from keeping the cost down  I am not sure why Logitech did not provide the option of a memory stick or something similar in order to expand the available memory  I will never go over the 80 pictures that can be saved  but you may  In this day and age  Logitech dropped the ball by not including this option with the 420 THE BOTTOM LINE We purchased the Logitech Clicksmart 420 as a second digital camera webcam and it has met our high expectations  We wanted something that we would not stress about while on vacation  We did not want to have to worry about it on the beach or fret over it falling out of the golf cart  We wanted a good camera that would do what we asked of it  take a decent picture  be trouble free  and easy to use  Finally  we did not want to spend a lot of money since this was going to be a second camera for us I would highly recommend the 420 for someone looking for a solid second camera  a starter digital camera  or a camera for a child  The 420 is easy to use  durable  and priced reasonably  
Camera, I didn t do too much homework in selecting this particular model at the time I was looking to upgrade from my 2 1 megapixel camera to a 3 megapixel camera without having to pay the current prices  So I spent my time lurking around the ubid website and won the bid on this particular model  For those who don t mind getting yesteryear s technology with the model being refurbished this is a great website to buy from I had a few brands in mind and lets just say this was one of them I felt comfortable in purchasing  In spite of all the purported shortcomings with this model they can be easily cured First  most people have complained about the short battery life and its somewhat proprietary battery  I ve solved this problem by buying a third party battery pack maha  that allows me to shoot with the monitor on for easily 5  hours and the battery was still strong  Second  issues with the small compact flash card provided  Well that is a standard practice and I ve been able to use quite a few offbrand cards in the camera simple technology  dan elec  i o data  with no problems  Third  the problem with the on off switch being easily tripped  My suggestion is to reverse the battery and this will prevent inadvertent powerups Now as to my observations on this model  Yes  this model is very compact which is great for those who might be travelers or those with small to average hands  But those with large hands might have trouble overgripping this model  The room between the grip and lens is pretty small now the lens does protrude so it would be hard to misplace a finger over the lens but the other hand might inadvertently cover the flash or viewfinder  This model comes with the capability for automatic mode and manual settings  I must say that if you are the type that does not enjoy reading manuals to find out about details don t get this camera it has an overly engineered menu and for some functions you have to be pushing down on two controls simultaneously aperture  shutter speed  iso setting With regards to the point and shoot capability the camera has some appealing features  The shutter button can be depressed partially to lock in a focus setting when the focus is not in the center of the frame  For a little more trouble one can switch to some ten specialized settings while in  scene  for optimized camera function to capture  portrait  indoor party  sunset  firework  etc  Now with regards to the more advanced settings I was a bit disappointed  First  the aperture setting only allows you to choose the outside ranges only  Setting the shutter  aperture  and iso required manipulation of two controls simultaneously which isn t conducive for rapid shooting  If you don t mind spending a couple of hours poring over the features than you probably will not mind the complexity My overall impression of this camera is favorable for the following reasons  its a compact model and the body is entirely plastic which makes for a very lightweight model  This comes in handy when one has extension lens on the camera  There are multiple settings besides the point and shoot mode allowing one to customize the aperture  shutter and iso sensitivity  One feature for those who like to know exact setting for every shot will enjoy the playback feature which lists all the photographic settings for each shot and this information can be downloaded to a text file  Besides the good selection of addon accessories for this model quite a few third party addons can be found  Comparing this model to more updated models in the nikon line 885  I didn t feel like i was losing that much  The zoom range is 3x versus 2 5x  Otherwise all the functionality seemed to be the same in both models  
Camera, Not me  That was my primary reason for purchasing this camera  I wanted to carry around something with me that took great pictures  didn t require film  and could fit in my pocket more or less Luckily  a co worker purchased this same camera before me and let me test drive it for a weekend  I loved it  I took pictures using the medium size  1280x1024  and medium compression and when I received my prints from ofoto  I was in awe they were indistinguishable from film  I m not a trained pro or anything  but that doesn t matter to me  I just wanted great prints that I could send to my parents and friends I ve been to China four times in the past year  not to mention many miscellaneous excursions in the Western U S  and have found the camera to be a great traveling companion  It s a great tool to preserve memories  While I love my S10  it s not without it s flaws First  I had to buy the battery and charger separately  They kit cost me about  75 if I remember correctly not very cheap  Also  you are unable to get a 2nd battery separately you have to buy another charger  I haven t checked in a while on this though  Second  the shutter is kinda slow there is very noticable delay from the time you press the button and the time the camera actually captures the image  This is resulted in countless blurred images from letting people who are not used to the delay take pictures for me  They end up snapping the picture and not realizing they had to wait an extra second for the camera to capture the image  start moving to return the camera to me when I check the camera  the image is blurred  Using the small screen  you can t always tell the image is blurred either another downside  My third major complaint is the zoom and the horrible digital zoom  The zoom is only 2x and that really doesn t do much  I m used to a 250mm zoom on my old SLR and this is nothing close  Luckily  I haven t had much occasion to use the zoom so it hasn t been too bad living with the zoom  Oh and the digital zoom is not usable at all it s slow and looks very bad  The minor complaint I have is durability  I m not one to really pamper my electronics especially trekking around China  but I ve tried to take fairly good care of my camera  The camera is still intact  the screen and body however are pretty scratched up  I don t really care about this as long as the camera works but some of you may After all the complaints  I ve come to realize that this is a fairly first generation product  but a damned good one  The negatives I pointed out above are far outweighed by the compactness and picture quality of the camera  I couldn t be happier with this camera well except if I could by an extra battery without another charger   
Camera, I just bought this camera a little over a week ago for a trip to Disney   I already had a Toshiba 2Mp Digital camera that I had been using for 2 years  but was not happy with the zoom and some other features  I consider myself a pretty serious picture taker  not an  expert  But I like photography  I am also somewhat of a technical buff I just got back from my trip and took more than 150 pictures   video clips  This camera was awesome  Very intuitive and easy to use  The prints came out great too  Definitely worth the money  I paid approx  360  including next day shipping  The 10x OPTICAL Zoom is great  Anyone who is a serious   knowledgeable picture taker knows that DIGITAL Zoom means absolutely nothing   You can always zoom the picture with your PC software  I bought the camera based upon other reviews I previously read in epinions  The only advance concerns I had  based upon the other reviews  was a comment about the lens cap and another comment about the AF noise while filming video clips  After using the camera for a week  I agree that the lens cap is a  little  inconvenient  but not really a problem  It could be better  but I didn t really mind  I did not experience the AF noise with my video clips Overall  this camera was great  I am very happy with it    Battery life was great  definitely better than with my previous digital camera  I just rotated a fresh set each day to be safe  even though the indicator was at full strength  I used Energizer 2100mA rechargeables  Optical Zoom was great   This was my main reason for buying this camera  Video clips were great quality  Easy to use  menus are very intuitive  Focus in dark light was very good  even without a flash  Easy to hook up to my PC and download pictures   The only issue I have here is that the software package provided could be a little better  My Toshiba software package was better  Other comments   Suggestions    You will need to buy a couple more SD cards  The one provided is only 16 Mb  typical  I bought 2 additional 128 MB cards  You will need to buy a bag  Buy an extra set of batteries  typical Can you tell that I like this camera  
Auto, I bought the Saturn SC2 because I heard they were very reliable and well built  Besides that  the price was perfect  No where else can you get all the features that Saturn offers for the price they offer  The car is also unbelievably safe  I was in a minor accident and could not believe how my Saturn held up and even more  how it protected me  The car is comfortable  sleek looking  and handles well in all types of weather  especially the snow and ice  If looking for a compact car that is dependable  well built  sleek looking  and safe for you and your entire family the Saturn is perfect  Not to mention Saturn service is the best service I have ever received  And that is what makes everything so much better br br  
Camera, I bought this camera for my boyfriend and reluctantly used it during our vacation to Europe  I was not disappointed  It took great  crisp pics and I was happily able to delete the pics I didn t want  The last time I went to Europe  I was a college kid  and was going for 6 weeks  I figured I d need 50 rolls of film  which I bought  I took pictures of everything and used up about 48 rolls  Spent hundreds of dollars on the film and developing  then on copies to give to friends family who wanted something  What a commitment  With the digital camera  you can email pics  print them up  send them out  make post cards  greeting cards  etc  without having to pay another dime to do so  So  you use up more ink in your printer  This is the true reason for color printers  To enhance our lives  I ve sent packets of wallet sized pics to friends and family so they can see what I did and where I was  The end of post cards  This trip marked the end of the post card for me  I spent about  1 25 for each card and stamp  I could have spent less than that by sending several small pics in a letter Anyway   I love the ability to zoom in and out  to take movies  soundless  15 or 33 seconds at a time  to delete pics that you ve changed your mind about or in which your friend s eyes are closed  Just take another two  three or four  and pick the one you like  delete the rest I don t like the fact that when you look through the view finder  you won t see the entire picture of what you re taking  Your view is cut off a bit  so you re actually including in your picture a little bit more than you re looking at  The batteries died maybe 1 week after my trip started  Thank goodness for the guy at J R who told me to get batteries  I brought rechargeable batteries and they worked well I used a SanDisk SmartMedia card and another one  can t remember the name  The second one gives me a  Card Error  when I was ready to upload the pics onto my desktop  Not something I want to see after taking pictures of beautiful Italy  After a few prayers and attempts  it worked  Haven t touched it since  All in all  this was a great buy and a good investment  My friend s digital camera had a smaller screen  and it wasn t as clear  Couldn t see certain details and it was slower  
Camera, I bought my Mavica a little over 7 months ago  I quickly grew to really appreciate its great photo quality  and its overall ease of use and convenience  Its a great camera which I rely on for many of my picture taking needs Some of the things which I really enjoy about it are 1  Excellent Photo Quality   Currently  I am taking most of my pictures at 640x480 resolution  and the quality is set to fine  At this rate  I can put about 14 16 snapshots of above average quality on each disk  If I want to take a  quot nicer quot  picture  I just need to increase the resolution  I ve printed pictures from it as well as posted them online  and in both cases  I ve felt that the pictures were of excellent quality  I was even able to frame a couple of the ones that I printed 2  Uses floppys to store pictures   Floppys are excellent for storing pictures  Instead of having to travel with multiple rolls of film  or having to buy several expensive media cards of some sort  I just carry around a box of 20 25 floppys which I can leave in the camera bag when I m taking pictures  It might not be the smallest setup you can carry around  but it is quite practical for most picture taking situations 3  Easy to download pictures   The floppys make it easy for you to download photos to any computer you want to  You don t need to drag the camera over to one particular machine in order to use a cable  or use special software to download it  You just pop out the disk  and put it in a disk drive  The picture files are saved as jpgs so they can be viewed with almost any graphics program 4  Very easy to use   This is a very simple camera to use  It does require that you spend some time learning to use it and getting familiar with its controls  but for the most part  that s normal for all good cameras  It has many many nice features which you don t need to use often  but most of its main controls are handled from on screen menus on the LCD screen  Navigating the menus is easy  and when it comes down to it  taking the pictures just requires that you point and shoot  The only reason that I would say this camera is not intuitive to use  is that it has so many functions  it takes some time to familiarize yourself with were they are  If you get this camera  spend a weekend playing around with it and testing out all of its features  and you ll feel quite comfortable using it Some things which I find somewhat annoying 1  Slow to write data to disks   This is the most annoying problem with this camera  It takes between 5 15 seconds for it to record each picture on the disk  During this time  you can t do anything with the camera  In most situations  this is not a huge problem  but it can be frustrating  I have also noticed that it takes it longer to finish writing a picture if you have zoomed in on your subject  2  Battery meter can be inaccurate   If you do extensive file viewing etc  the battery can wear out surprisingly fast  Not only that  but the meter tends to not report accurately while you are viewing files  In general though  once you know this  you can be careful and the battery will last for quite a while 3  Somewhat large bulky   This is not a small camera  It is a fair bit bigger than small point and shoot cameras and it is bigger than the body of most SLRs  This is not a major drawback  but it can be somewhat annoying when you are packing for a trip  It is fairly light though  so its extra size does not really affect its overall usability 4  Mpeg quality isn t great   The quality of its Mpegs isn t really good  I ve tried different options  but it just doesn t produce output which I am satisfied with  This is almost certainly because this is primarily a camera for still photographs which also happens to record some video  It is possible to record the occasional ok mpeg  but I don t think that Sony spent much effort on this particular feature  All things considered  I really do like this camera  It does have a few things which I find somewhat troublesome  but none of them are really that terrible  I only mention them so that people with specific camera needs aren t taken by surprise  For instance  this is not a great camera for recording high action sports type shots  Its also not good as a video camera  If you are looking for a good  reliable  camera which is very flexible  and easy to work  then you should definitely consider this  Its output is top notch  While it is not quite up to par with the best SLR cameras out there  it easily handles 90  of the photography tasks which you might encounter and it gives you great results br br  
Auto, My grandfather had given me his 1983 CHEVROLET CAPRICE CLASSIC when I was 14 I am 18 now  I loved it  it was a big car and it was not a new body style  I love the room and comfort  the ride of it is awesome  it seems to float going down the road  I am graduating this year and my parents offered to buy me a new vehicle  but I said I would drive my CHEVY CAPRICE until it died on me  which probably won t happen any time soon  it ha over 265 000 miles on it when my ORIGINAL speedometer cable broke on me and I just never felt like replacing it  Anyone looking for a great car that will last them years on end should purchase a CHEVY CAPRICE or any CHEVY  The only other vehicle I have ever driven was a ford ranger and I replaced everything with CHEVY parts that was ford except for the frame and body  but I did cut the body a little  It was used strictly for racing  I have also raced my CHEVY CAPRICE and had fun doing it  it has a 305 4bbl with an automatic trans  I ran 11 21 in the 1 8 and 17 89 in the 1 4 br br  
Camera, I had been hinting at a digital camera for Christmas but was surprised when my husband actually got one  After talking to several people  both sales people and those that had digital cameras  he chose the Olympus D 490 Zoom  It s been very easy to figure out with the help of the manual  The manual itself is easy to understand and it s not difficult to find something if I have a question  The camera can be used in two different ways  You can simply open the cover and point and shoot  or you can also open the lens cover and view your subjects through the monitor  much like looking through a cam corder screen  So far the pictures have been of good quality  though I haven t tried to print one out yet  Because my main objective at this point is to email pictures to friends and family I can choose a lower resolution setting and get more pictures at a time  but if I chose to print it s very easy to change the settings to a higher resolution  I d like to have a few of the accessories but the camera works just fine without them  they would just make the download to my computer easier and faster  I have an older computer so it takes a couple of minutes to download but not so long that it gets frustrating  
Auto, I have found my inner child  and he s a thirteen year old boy  This is a tremendous discovery for someone s mother to make  if you ask me  but I think it s true  The whole thing started because my old Mazda RX 7 needed work  A lot of work  I owned the car outright  but it had reached the age where it was going to take thousands of dollars a couple of times a year to keep it driving anything like I wanted  Despite argument from my significant other  my emotional attachment to the RX 7   my first ever fun car   was such that I really did plan to just keep fixing it again and again  or else replace it with a newer RX 7 if I could find one  Well  just as I was about to finally bite the bullet and get major transmission work done on the RX 7  my main squeeze threw me and our two year old son in his van  and took me out to a car lot where  side by side  sat a used Corvette and a newer RX 7 turbo  I test drove the RX 7  and found it similar to the one I already had  only with absolutely zero cargo space  I planned to test drive the Vette  but they d locked the keys in the car  Inspired  though  I headed to the Chevy dealership to see if they had any used Vettes  And they did   but not in my price range  To my surprise  though  the showroom floor Camaro SS was available at a price I could talk myself into  Giggling a little inside  I took a Camaro SS for a test drive  I was surprised by how much I liked it  Tons of zip  enough cargo space to pick up a reasonable load of groceries if I needed to  comfortable seats that were even big enough for my son s car seat  if only I liked the way it looked  I thanked the Chevy dealer for the test drive  and headed up the street to the Pontiac dealer  where I found a bargain  a low miles  bright red 1995 Trans Am  six speed with the Hurst shifters  half the price of the new Camaro SS  So I took that one for a ride too First of all  I have bad knees  So a few years ago  I came to grips with the notion that I wouldn t be driving stick anymore  It had been years  but it came right back driving that fun car  a little slow stop and start around surface streets  then out onto the highway and next thing I know  there I am in 6th  severely over the speed limit at 1500 rpm  I took the car out of gear  got off the freeway  and went back to the dealership  angel on one shoulder saying  quot But remember  you can t drive stick anymore  remember your knees shaking in traffic quot  and devil on the other saying   quot Who cares  Who CARES  This car RULES quot  This  like I say  is where the teenage boy comes in I looked at every Trans Am on that lot  Unlike the Camaros  they didn t have any automatics in stock  I worked that dealer  had him showing me every little feature of every Trans Am  and then I got back in the aged RX 7 and  responsibly  drove home without buying a stick But back at the house  I started my Trans Am research in earnest  I was intrigued to compare Firebirds and Camaros  learning that more Camaros are made than Firebirds  that a larger percentage of women buy Firebirds than Camaros  while the opposite is true of Camaros  I walked around for a few days saying things like  quot Hey  it s a version of the Corvette engine quot  and  quot I think traction control would be a major plus quot  and  quot Okay  can you explain the difference between gear ratio and axle ratio quot Just like that  I d managed to tell myself I could sever my emotional bond with my RX 7  and I knew that I wanted to replace it with a hefty American V8  For a new  sporty car  that meant I had 3 options  Firebird  Camaro  or Mustang  For a slightly used car  a Corvette Frankly  I just don t like the looks of the new Mustang at all  And to get the same horsepower that are standard with a Camaro or Firebird  I would have had to spring for a Mustang SVT Cobra  with a higher sticker price than I wanted to pay for a car whose looks I don t like  and which I constantly see lots of on the road anyway  What s more  I fail to see why the absolute top of the line Mustang  the SVT Cobra R  actually gets any play when you could buy a new Corvette for the same price  People actually pick a Mustang over a Vette  Ford must have some advertising whizzes  But naaaah  the Mustang was never a contender for me The used Corvette was  However  after a fair amount of contemplation  I decided that what I really wanted to do was buy my first brand new car  where I got to pick out the colour and everything  and it came with a solid warranty and no miles on it and it would be mine from the very beginning  So  back to Camaro vs  Firebird  First of all  the base V6 was right out  I m sure it s a great car  but after driving the 305 horsepower V8s  I had to have one  I didn t even bother to test drive the 200 horsepower V6 Firebird or Camaro  If I d been in the market for a V6  however  either the Camaro or the Firebird would have been a hands down win over the V6 Mustang  which I ve rented and  frankly  enjoyed less than a Camry   which is too bad  because I wanted to like the Mustang  Deciding between the Camaro and Firebird ended up being easier than one might think  While I liked the way the Camaro handled  and its features and options  and while the price was right and there were plenty of Camaro SSes around that were automatic transmission  the bottom line is I liked the looks of the Trans Am better  It took me the better part of a week to find an automatic Trans Am to test drive  to be sure I liked the way the automatic transmission felt  Deep down  the teenage boy inside me kept hollering the whole time   quot You don t care  So what about your knees  Get this one  Get it  Get it  Yeah  Don t drive the dying RX 7 off this lot quot When I finally found one  it was an automatic Trans Am with the WS6 performance package on it  and it was a 2001  which meant I wouldn t be able to take advantage of the  1500 rebate for the 2000 model year  and the bottom line there was that the car was just a little more expensive than I really wanted to pay  for features that I wasn t likely to ever really capitalize on   17 quot  wheels  15 more horses  and the functional scoops with tougher looking hood  for example I ended up picking out an automatic Trans Am to be delivered from about a hundred miles away  with the only options being chromed wheels  traction control  and the  quot performance axle quot  with the 3 23 ratio  While the waiting for the car to be delivered was sheer torture  I could not be happier with the vehicle First of all  I m thrilled with its pure oomph  I m learning to drive all over again   if I drive this car the way I drove the RX 7  I m going to get arrested  Step anything but lightly on the accelerator when the light turns green  and the tires will squeal  This car is very quick off the line   the same kind of driving that would keep me reasonably in step with other cars before now leaves me seeing them far back in the rear view mirror  Of course  this means I ve got to be vigilant if I m not the first one up at the light   Pickup is exceptional  even at highway speeds  This means the car really is terrific in California freeway traffic  if I need to be somewhere else  fast  it s no problem  It s great to have the power to accelerate out of potentially sticky situations even when the overall flow of traffic is already exceeding the speed limit  I m also very happy with braking  since I don t have downshifting for an added measure of control  in an automatic  and the car s overall responsiveness  Take a week of Silicon Valley driving  and you re guaranteed a few chances to find out how your car reacts to adverse traffic scenarios  While I ve heard complaints about visibility  I have to say it s superior to what I had in the RX 7  Yes  the rear window is short  so you don t get a tall view of the road there  and that takes some getting used to  as does seeing the rear spoiler in the reflection  However  the side mirrors are excellent  and the glance over the shoulder blind spot is much smaller than the one I had with the RX 7  which was enough of a blind spot to hide an entire Geo Metro  ask me how I learned that one  I didn t get the driver s seat with lumbar support  just the basic 6 way power seat  If I were expecting to do nonstop roadtrips  or if I already had back problems  I would likely have opted for the upgraded seat  but I m perfectly happy with this one  and suspect I would be even for the occasional roadtrip  However  I expect a passenger would want to make more frequent stops to stretch his legs  given the lump in the floor which I understand hides the catalytic converter  and no one but a child could make a roadtrip in this vehicle as a back seat passenger Speaking of children  my son s toddler car seat fits quite nicely in the back  and there are tether strap anchor points for two car seats  While I think his view was better from the passenger seat of the two seater RX 7  in the Trans Am he can watch all the mirrors and has the view out the tinted glass T tops  Although he does tend to kick the passenger seat some  he s got enough room to be comfortable  and his major problem appears to be when we stop   he will start screaming   quot Go  Go  Go  car quot  I also find that it s nice to be able to reach easily to hand him things and so forth  without having to tell him to keep his hand off the shifter and not kick the stereo  like in a 2 seater  And of course  I love it that now all three people in our family can go for a ride in the fun car at once  The stereo is great  I did not opt for the 12 CD changer  figuring that if I do someday decide I want one  I can probably find one that will work with the car s head unit for under  600  the price of the factory installed changer  I m definitely going to get spoiled by the radio controls on the steering wheel  too I m thrilled with the T tops as an open air alternative to a convertible  Lots more openness than even a huge power moonroof gave me on the RX 7  and little enough wind turbulence that  even though I have three feet of hair  I am comfortable and hair doesn t get blown in my face  restricting my vision  An equally long haired passenger reported the same thing  I ve been advised  about the T tops  to unlatch them in the event that the car ever needs to be jacked up  so as to avoid any potential torque being applied to that part of the car  which could result in a leaky T top  By the same token  the manual says never to take the car through a car wash that sprays high pressure water in the area of the T tops  so it looks like this will be a wash by hand car forever  What s more  the manual says the chromed wheels are prone to damage by brushes in a car wash  so I guess I ll be washing it and making periodic visits to the upscale car detailers  Though classified as a sub compact  this is a bigger car than you would think  It s nearly as long as my main squeeze s extended GMC Safari  and weighing in at 3500 pounds  almost as much as a Coupe DeVille and more than a Chevy S 10 pickup   this car weighs as much as some SUVs  So you can t drive it like you would a lightweight vehicle  Nor does this vehicle get subcompact gas mileage  for Silicon Valley traffic driving  admittedly with the air conditioning on  I seem to be getting about 17 miles to the gallon The list of standard features on a Trans Am is truly exceptional  especially for the price  No  it doesn t have the full complement of luxury sedan features  but one wouldn t expect it to  But the list of standard equipment is long enough that it barely fits in the section for it on the car s window sticker  Overall  I would wholeheartedly recommend this car to anyone who wants a fun  fast car  with a few caveats  you won t be able to fit a huge amount of cargo in it  though it s got adequate space  you won t be able to carry around a gaggle of your friends  and it will be anything but cheap to fill it with the premium gas the manual sternly recommends  Additionally  I would not recommend this car to an inexperienced driver  The steep rake angle of the hood makes it hard to get a feel for where the car ends  and similarly  it s hard to know this moving in reverse  Further  with the major amount of oomph right at all speeds I ve driven so far  and a top speed that s supposed to be 160 MPH  I would not recommend this for a driver who is inexperienced or prone to recklessness   which is bad news  I suppose  for teenage boys who aren t inner children br br  
Auto, Why buy a Forester over a CRV Pros Much more powerful Engine 165 hp vs 125 hp Much safer  Only mini SUV without rollover warning Much more for your dollar Subaru s All Wheel Drive system is amazing Cons More expensive to insure  due to average cost of repairs We love  the room  feel and cost of this vehicle We hate  the price of repairs on it Who should drive this vehicle Small families who want an economical vehicle that offers some room for shipping and is safe Our story After quite an exhaustive comparison process we purchased a Forester over a Honda CRV  We had are minds made up before even shopping for a mini SUV on a Honda CRV  We test drove the CRV and thought it was great  We put a down payment down  they said that we could have a week to think about it  Durring this week I was alerted by the safety reports on mini SUV s  After further investigation I discovered that the Forester had the only acceptable crash test results of a car in its class We went out and test drove a Subaru  Right of the bat you notice a huge power difference in the Forester over the CRV  This makes sense when you consider the 165 hp vs 125 hp engine difference  The all wheel drive system in the Subaru is impressive  Living in Minnesota you can it is a huge plus over the CRV  the one we tested was 2WD  As for price  the CRV appears cheaper but if you compare the base model Forester L  which has AWD  A C  power windows locks  ABS  and then the base model CRV plus the 4WD option  ABS option  and the Power windows locks you are looking at a savings of roughly  1500 dollars on the Subaru  As for space  they were both pretty equal  Both lacked the leg room in the back seat  but that is to be expected with a mini SUV  Both had ample room once the back seats were lowered The only drawback in the Forester is the price to insure  The CRV is less expensive to insure  This price is based on the average cost of repairs br br  
Auto, I bought a 2001 Corolla LE in August 2000 and have put on about 50 000 miles  I originally owned an  83 Tercel that taught me the virtues of a long lasting simple automobile  I drove cross country six times in the  Yoter  and only had to change a fuel pump and some warped rotors along the way   but those happened well after the car had 100 000 miles OK  back to the Corolla  After living in Baltimore for a couple of years  the exterior has an interesting assortment of dings  dents  and scratches  but the interior is pure gold  No problems with any mechanical or electrical system  everything works just like the day I bought it Fuel economy is excellent  and I m the type of person who calculates it religiously   I have a 5 speed and I usually average 38 39 mpg with mostly highway driving  If I do more in town driving  that might drop to about 36 mpg  Performance is fair to middling   acceleration is slow in first gear  second is better  and third has some muscle  The clutch is not too forgiving and takes some practice  and the hair trigger accelerator doesn t help matters much  I ve done some severe weather driving and the car is sure footed in snow and rain   front wheel drive and the manual transmission do the trick  Braking is OK but requires more force on the pedal than one might be used to  especially in an emergency situation  Handling is fairly tight but the car s cheap suspension and 14 inch wheels show up on bumpy terrain  Despite occasional discomfort the suspension appears to be hardy  having dealt with Baltimore s awful streets without any repairs to date  and a high speed impact with a rock on the highway didn t cause any damage beyond a tire Let s talk about size for a moment  I m 6 foot 5 inches tall  and I m at my limit in terms of interior space  and forget it for the person in the back seat behind me  But the weird thing is I ve sat in a lot of so called bigger cars and they re all worse  Even the new Cadillacs  One notable exception is the Volkswagen Golf  which has a great front seat and lots of legroom  The Corolla has pretty generous head room but the leg room is tight  I recommend cruise control so at least you can move around a little on longer trips Interior ergonomics are efficient and to the point  Controls and displays are easy to use and designed to last  The cruise control has a great feature where you can push the lever up to go 1 mph faster or down to go 1 mph slower  I also like the automatic headlights   you never have to worry about turning them on or off Good design extends to the engine compartment  All the fluids are very easy to check and refill if necessary  The air filter and lightbulbs are easy to change too  The engine itself is all aluminum and you don t see the usual copious amount of plastic  There s a generous space between the bumper and the engine  which would save lots of dough in a front end crash In this age of monster SUVs  the issue is going to be  is it too small  But let me point out the benefits   tight turning circle  getting into those parking spots nobody else can  and the ability to weave through city traffic  The Corolla has a big trunk  no problem packing up for a two week vacation  And on smooth roads you can pretend you re in a much bigger car  Another advantage of small is affordability   I paid 15 grand including taxes and tags  a pretty good deal considering how long I expect the car to last Based on my past experience with the Tercel  200 000 miles is a reasonable lifetime for the Corolla  and the repairs I expect to make are new brakes  300  and tires  350  around 75K miles  and again at 150K  and possibly a new alternator  300  starter  300  struts  300  and waterpump  300  around 100 150K miles  OK  maybe the fuel pump  200  at some point too  The exhaust systems and AC last forever on the Corolla  according to Consumer Reports surveys  The key is that these items are easy to identify when they break and don t rack up the bill for labor By the way  these prices assume that you never  never take your car to the dealer  which is the ultimate no no if you want to save money on car repairs  With the Corolla  you can gleefully ignore the recommended servicing  just have your local mechanic check things when you go in for an oil change  Look for that gas station repair shop with a guy named Chip  Mike  Steve  or Joe  that ll be your place The Corolla is a car for people that want to  or have to  drive in an urban suburban environment without worrying about things breaking  and save lots of money along the way  This is the car that will take a licking and keep on ticking  but it s still a big step up from my old no AC  AM radio Yoter  which I affectionately called  the lawnmower with wheels  
Camera, I was looking for a replacement for my Nikon 950 a long time ago and wanted to try something else  The Canon S20 was the smallest 3 3Mpel camera I could find  and did not look as  clunky  as the nikon coolpix 990 There were a few signs of trouble from the beginning  1  I find the flash was even weaker than the old nikon950 which was itself not bright enough  Taking pictures indoors or at night is not worth the effort if your room light is low  Pictures always comes out bad 2  It takes non std batteries that don t last as long  The old nikon950 took AA s so I could get 1500mAH NiMH rechargeables cheaply and they last long enough for me to fill a 128MB CF outdoors if I switched off the monitor  This one requires a  100 rechargeable battery that WILL not even fill half of a 128MB CF  This means you really need two of them for a proper session  IE  we are talking  200 extra for batteries here instead of  25 for AA NiMH and charger 3  When viewed on a screen  the extra pixels did not make the pictures any better than my old Nikon coolpix 950  In fact  when I took similar material in bright sunlight   I saw that the pictures look either too blue or too red  but the color was definitely off here If I didn t already own a nikon coolpix 950  I would have thought this was a great camera  but I did  so this is not a good one to buy  Spend a little more and get a better camera I was disappointed with this camera  and will probably get another brand when I upgrade  perhaps a higher res Nikon  
Camera, I received the FujiFilm MX 600Zoom Camera for christmas this year  My father and I picked it out together and opted to get the 8 meg chip so that we d have more room for pics  We have never been sorry  This camera is compact yet takes excellent pictures  The zoom feature works great for capturing details and the colors are amazing  The upload software that comes with the camera is so simple to use  that my 9 year old can do it  The Adobe Picture This software that is included is also easy to use and has so many extra features that I ve almost completely given up my old standard cannon camera for good I use this camera mainly for adding pictures to my online auctions  but it works equally well for grabbing those great candid pictures of my 3 children  There is nothing like emailing pictures to the grandparents just minutes after they were taken  Finally  pictures to share when the kids still look like that Definitely worth the money  but I highly recommend getting the additional chip for more pics  Directions are easy to understand and it functions wonderfully br br  
Camera, As the heir apparent to the C 2500L from Olympus  I expected great things from the C 2100UZ  My expectations were  perhaps  a little too high The C 2100 features a 10x optical zoom  This is far better than most other consumer and prosumer cameras  digital or not  It uses SmartMedia for storage and ships with an 8MB card  A lens cover and shoulder strap are included  Four AA NiMH batteries and a charger are included as well  Olympus  CAMEDIA 2 0 and Adobe PhotoDeluxe are provided on CD for Windows and Mac  USB is the only connection available between the camera and a computer  therfore only USB equipped machines running Windows 98  Windows 2000 or Mac OS 9 will work with the camera  Olympus makes a point of noting that even USB equipped machines that have been upgraded to Windows 98 from Windows 95 will NOT work with the camera  An A V cable is supplied for connecting to televisions and VCRs The maximum resolution of the camera is 1600x1200 or 2 1 megapixels  This is less than other current leading edge cameras feature  The camera can save in TIFF or JPEG and can also capture short  30 sec  QuickTime movie clips with sound at 15 frames per second  A continuous drive mode can capture about seven super high quality shots in about four seconds time  That does not include the time it takes to save the images to the memory card  An infra red remote is included for timed shots The C 2100UZ is styled as an SLR camera  Cameras in this category are identified by their ability to accurately frame pictures by using through the lens  TTL  view finders  While this makes a big difference on traditional film cameras  it is not as big a selling point on digital cameras which use LCD displays that by their very nature display TTL images that can be used for framing a shot  Of the few SLR digital cameras available  the benfefit to the TTL viewfinder is that the image is purely optical  That is  you can see all the detail that a LCD screen cannot display  The C 2100 breaks this tradition by using a miniature LCD in the viewfinder instead of optics  This gives the camera a video camera type of feel  The benefit of this setup is the massive amount of setting information that can be displayed while framing a picture  including the effects of exposure compensation  The drawback is the lack of fine detail that true optics provide  Back to the benefits  playback can be done on the viewfinder s LCD which uses far less power than the large rear mounted LCD  A button switches the display between the mini LCD and the large LCD at any time during capture or playback The camera s imaging sensor  CCD  supports ISO equivalent sensitivities of 100  200 and 400  In point and shoot mode  the camera can select between these settings automatically  Expect a tendency to use a higher film speed when set to auto mode  As with all digital cameras  there is a significant amount of image noise captured when higher speeds are used The manual controls for shutter speed  aperture and manual focus are very flexible  More flexible than even the C 2500L s controls  The manual focus control could have been made a little easier to use  although its feature of enlarging the image to show more detail while adjusting is handy  Shutter priority and aperture priority modes are available in addition to a full manual mode  A handful of special modes are available under a special setting mode  This mode includes pre determined settings for night shots  portraits  and landscapes Speaking of controls  most controls are easy to use  Remember though   it is not a point and shoot camera so expect to take some time to learn all the settings to get full use out of the camera Operation of the camera was not speedy  but it wasn t a dog either  Playbacks were fairly fast  When capturing  cycle time between single shots was about three seconds  Power on to first shot was four to five seconds without flash  Continuous drive shots were about two to three frames per second without flash  Expect delays when taking multiple shots while the camera saves to the slow SmartMedia memory card By the way  what s up with Olympus only supplying an 8MB card  It can only hold about sixteen shots  The C 2100 s predecessor   the C 2500L   shipped with a 32MB card  Get a bigger card if your going to use this camera I was disappointed that the resolution of the camera was only 2 1 megapixels  With the industry trend to create high resolution pictures for better prints  this is a step backwards  The amazing 10x zoom almost makes up for this  quot flaw quot  For those looking to get closer to the action  you can t find much better than the zoom capabilities of this camera  Coupled with a 2 7x continuous digital zoom  total  27x zoom  you won t find a solution in this price range that can beat the C 2100 For me  however  superior prints are more desirable than high zoom levels Actual picture quality was good  but I did notice poor color accuracy in low light situations when a flash was not used  When a flash is used  careful control needs to be used so that your subject is not washed out  Image sharpness was good  The built in focus assist light allowed the camera to focus in low light with little difficulty  Of course  images captured at higher ISO settings were fraught with pixel noise  Images captured at ISO 100 were as clean as can be expected Overall  I would recommend this camera to those needing exceptional zoom capabilities who are not looking to print the images at large sizes There are better alternatives for those looking for better quality images or faster cameras  These alternatives include other cameras from Olympus like the E 10  4 megapixel  4x zoom  and the E 100 RS  1 5 megapixel  10x zoom  15 frames per second

Camera, I have doubted many other digital cameras in the past but this camera I have to say can get the job done  I have used it at parties  for ebay and yahoo auctions  So far I can say the pictures come out clean and crisp  The flash works well in complete darkness too  I would have favored a larger smartmedia card because the 4MB they give you just isn t enough when you re on the run  And the batteries died out on me quick  I tried w o out using the LCD screen  but the viewfinder is just too small Overall I would recommend this camera to any person looking for something decent and just to say they have a digital camera that works  but for high end applications you might want to look for the new Sony MVC     
Auto, We purchased a  99 Hyundai Elantra Wagon Wildberry color  amp  it is fabulous  No blind sports to obscur vision as the Taurus wagon had  10 year powertrain warranty  5 year 60K bumper to bumper warranty with a 5 year emergency repair line  FREE  A refill of gas is FREE on the freeway The back storage is wider than my  95 Saturn wagon I traded in for it  100 watt cd player  amp  6 speakers give a whole new meaning to performers Then only bad part is what they call a center console with armrest  The storage compartment with armrest is the size of a cell phone  A bic pen put into it won t close the lid  So passenger gets armrest  my husband wins  Store CD in a rack on the back floor  Lumbar support was also included in the driver s seat  Cruise control is very easy to operate Electronic locks operate all doors  amp  trunk in one quick click  Very safe car br br  
Auto, I purchased a 92 grand am used with 80 000 miles on it in 1994  I picked it up for a great price thinking how many miles can an american car get out of it  I now have 218 000 miles on it and still wonder when i should get a new car  I try to keep up on oil changes regularly but some tines I am not prompt  I can say that over the years the car has been driven mostly city miles and driven hard and I have to say this car still runs great  The only problem I have really had was the struts and shocks were changed 3 times and the rear wheel cylinders were just changed  I have the grand am se with the 3 3l engine automatic  The only complaint I have is the window on the driver side the track is broken and window has to be pulled up  I strongly recommend this car for anyone interested and will strongly consider buying another grand am when and if this car finally gives out  i have to say I dont see any signs of this happening too soon   
Camera, over all Nikon 880 carries on the reputation of great nikon optics and design  over image quality is great  as long as the image compression is at fine or higher  design camera body is very compact  I wish it has a pivoting lcd viewfinder  as nikon 990 or the canon g1  you do have to remember to set control dial to play or setup  to avoid accidentally turn on the camera with lens cap on   it will jam the lens  though it happens quite a lot of time  and did not really do any damage to mine control I did notice some unreliability of shutter control to hold  half way  so when you are getting a new one  test it out  on some cameras  you can not hold halfway at all  it s important when you want to hold the focus  etc optics good overall  does have noticeable barrel distortion  but ok for most of the landscapes shots  fast zoom control  yet focus is a little slow  macro function is amazing  you can get easily great photo close up stills  and available lens accessories shared with nikon 990 are very useful  ability to scan slides is truly unique  and the results are quite ok battery life 2 rechargeable batteries are expensive investment  but absolutely essential for serious shooters  and should be enough for a whole day field trip  overall  battery life is very good expections rotatable lcd viewfinder   already realized in the new model a easy way to attach a filter lens   this represent a problem for most of the compact digi  cams  with retractable lens  
Camera, Having owned the DSC P1  I traded in my P1 for a DSC P7  Although the megapixel count was the same  it was a big step up for several reasons Thinness The camera is thinner than the P1 and definitely fits into a pants or shirt pocket very easily  On my 80 s style tight jeans  I often forget that the camera is even in my back pocket LCD screen The LCD is viewable in sunlight conditions  However  the screen does protrude significantly from the rest of the back of the camera  tarnishing the overall slimness of the camera  It s a bit irritating given the overall svelteness and sleekness of the camera  Even with that the camera is very pocketable Taking Pictures The shutter lag is now on par with most digicams  about 0 5 seconds  Picture quality is good Movie Editing The really neat feature is that you can cut slice movies to remove unwanted segments  This happens in edit mode  and is really handy for freeing up memory space when you re away from a PC Quick Movie Turnaround Movies are streamed directly to memory  Once you finish taking a movie  you can immediately shoot your next movie  This is a great feature compared with other cameras that require a waiting period to write to memory before shooting the next movie Movie Length Movies are limited in duration only by the size of the memory stick  which for a 128MB Stick is about 6 minutes in High Quality 320x240  23 minutes in 320x240  and 90 minutes in 160x120 Still Image Shooting Not much to say here  except that it shoots like most 3 2MP point n shoots  It doesn t have any direct manual controls over shutter speed or aperture  and it lacks shutter  aperture priority modes  So it isn t a primary camera for pros  but it does make a great point n shoot camera  backup camera  or take anywhere anytime camera  
Camera, My company evaluated half a dozen different digital cameras to determine the best overall product to incorporate into our id badging packages  The Sony proved to be the simplest to operate  no matter what the user s skill level was  It has an excellent range of features  was intuitive to use  compact  medium weight  and the choice of a 3 5 quot  floppy as the transfer method ensures that most of the customer base is already equipped to download images  Also  the variety of file formats available to save images reinforces the camera s utility The bundled software is perhaps too limited in scope  especially compared to the broad market design thinking behind the camera s engineering  Plus  of the near dozen cameras I ve provided to customers  two had a defective pixel in the built in display  The images themselves are crystalline in their purity  so it s a relatively minor complaint  but a valid one nonetheless  Overall  the camera is worth every penny  and promises to give full value over it s lifetime  The Sony name is nearly always an indicator of quality  and Sony upholds the grand tradition yet again br br  
Camera, Excellent reproduction for cost  Excellent resolution and more than satisfactory resolution  Easily makes excellent print reproductions that are a better quality than 35mm  Camera easy to use as it operates in both manual or automatic modes  Uses 4 AA batteries to add life to number of pictures it can take before power dies  Nikon lens is  as usual of Nikon quality  excellent  Have used camera for six months with only satisfactory results  Especially like macro feature which allows pictures to be taken within 3 inches of subject  Camera is built to fit hand and all features are within easy reach  Anyone looking for high quality results at a moderate cost should consider purchasing this product br br  
Camera,  Note  Update  150 5 2 03 I have updated the original  Hope this review will be useful in helping you all  I have added more information such as lens flare  graininess etc  P S  I am  STILL  on the original bundled alkaline batteries so wow  5 stars for energy efficiency  Now I have taken about a hundred high quality shots and about 20 minutes of video and frequent use of LCD for reviewing etc  Flash use is moderate b First  a little rant on choosing either A70 or A60 b The PowerShot A60 is almost identical to the 3 mega pixel A70  Physically  the only difference is a gray handgrip on the A70 while the A60 s is blue  Functional differences are  640x480 movie mode for the A70  slightly faster multiple pictures shooting  about 2 6 fps vs  2 2 fps  and of course  the increase in mega pixels  So  if you do not need the extra pixels for printing 8x10 or larger pictures  the A60 will give you almost the same features as the A70  Both cameras support direct print to compatible printers such as Canon CP 10 and S800D   Note  The A60 146s max resolution is actually adequate to produce decent 8 x 10 prints as I 146ve tried it myself You might think that since it 146s only  100 more  why not get the A70 anyway for the higher pixels  Well  because if you are never going to print such large pictures  which uses a lot of ink and is expensive to print with ink jet printers  or a VGA movie mode which really needs a huge Compact Flash card  then  you are really paying for pixels you 146ll never use  So why not use the  100 to buy an extra set of rechargeable batteries and a fast travel charger  That 146s better investment  A digicam is unlike a computer  more pixels doesn t mean future proofing  unlike PCs  where more megahertz or CPU clock speed means better future proofing  You only need as much pixels depending on the sizes of photos you ll need to print with good details   Buying accessories 133   If you bought the A60  you could probably get a 128MB CompactFlash Card  a mini USB CF card reader  and a soft case with the money saved from not getting the A70  Or  you could opt for a 64MB card and a set of NiMH batteries and charger  Or you could use the money saved to get a set of photo ink cartridges and photo paper for your printer  Of course  if you have the money to spare  then go ahead with the A70  The A60 shoots up to 1600 x 1200 and the A70 up to 2048 x 1536 pixels  I normally shoot at 1600 x 1200 which is sufficient to produce great 5 x 7 photos  and decent 8 x 10 as I 146ve experienced  This lower resolution  compared to the A70 146s max res  also allows me to take more pictures with the bundled 16 megabyte card  The camera is very comfortable to hold with a large handgrip  also part of the battery compartment  It 146s a bit tubby though and weighs around 300 grams with batteries  This means it 146s comfortable and steady in your hands but will not fit smaller pockets as easily as a Sony U20  nor as portable   In the box 133   The camera comes with a 16 megabyte Compact Flash card  a wrist strap  software and camera manuals  two software CDs  4 AA alkaline batteries  USB and video out cables  No soft case is included but I got one for free  The 16 megabyte card is too small by today 146s standards  You can only take about 16 pictures at the highest quality setting  The camera is recognized automatically by Windows XP but on older systems  you will need to install the software drivers  Now I 146ll get straight to what you probably want to know  how does it perform   Performance   Ever since getting this camera  I have taken about 3 dozen photos of various subjects ranging from kids to pets and close ups of plants and animals  I wish I can post these pictures here so you can see for yourself that this Canon takes excellent quality photos  Of course  you can also visit the many websites out there that feature reviews and sample pictures taken with the A60 or A70  Judge for yourself but I am extremely satisfied with the quality myself  Details are excellent  especially in close ups and portraits  Indoor pictures with flash come out excellent as well  This is taken with the AUTO mode on  there are 12 shooting modes all in all  Colors such as skin tones are spot on as well  Startup time is about 3 seconds before you can begin shooting  Shutter lag is hardly there in bright daylight or fast shutter speeds but becomes more apparent when shooting in dark indoors or at night  Still  very fast response in my use My previous digicam was a first generation 0 8 mega pixel Fuji and the pictures taken were too warm  I 146m really surprised at how far digicams have come today to producing the best and most accurate colors even in tricky indoor lighting conditions  I have printed out only three photos on my home Canon bubble jet printer  4 x 6  and the results quite good  With my old Fuji  I often had to correct and adjust the pictures before printing but with this camera  little adjustment and color correction is needed   Picture softness b I have also sent off my CF card for processing at a digital color lab  Fujifilm Digital Imaging  and the results  although a bit soft as testified by many other A70 A60 owners  look very pleasing with very good colors and decent detail level  The softness can easily be corrected through software sharpening before being printed out and even if sharpening is not done  it 146s still not that big of a deal  especially considering how many other positives the camera has going for it  I also notice that sharper digicam pictures also look grainier most times  The pictures on the A60 may not be super sharp but there is very little grain  especially at either ISO 50 or ISO 100  I heard the same is true for the S45 but have not seen pictures from the newer G3  I have handled the older G2 and it 146s just too bulky and heavy for my purposes but pictures are gorgeous As for  lens flare  I noticed a bit of it when shooting with the bright sun in the background or directly at it  There is also a bit of flare when shooting oncoming traffic  from headlights  at night  It isn 146t very bad compared with some other cameras I have used though  In fact  it performs better than with my Samsung camera that 146s equipped with a Sneichder Kreuznach lens which is supposed to be specially coated to minimize lens flare b Creative possibilities   One of the main reasons why I got this camera is because it offers so much creative control such as Aperture priority  Shutter priority  Program AE and full manual control  In manual mode  you can change all exposure controls and settings  You can select shutter speeds of 15 seconds to 1 2000th of a second  aperture sizes of F2 8 to F8  different flash modes  auto focus  5 point or center focus  or manual focus  metering  center weighted  evaluative or spot  and many others  This is simply amazing and unbelievable at this price  There is even a custom white balance setting that you can set with either a white or gray card  There is no option to save your custom exposure settings though unlike the S45 which has one custom setting and the G3 which has two  No big loss  All other exposure settings remain the same after you set them as the information is stored in the camera and maintained by a small lithium battery  which also maintains date  For example if you choose Shutter priority mode and set your shutter speed at 1 60  it will remain the same when you turn the camera off and then on to manual mode  There 146s also a focus assist light which is hardly found in budget digicams  Very useful for shooting in the dark and also acts as the red eye reduction lamp A Stitch assist mode lets you create splendid panorama shots by  147stitching 148 together multiple shots either horizontally or vertically or 360 degrees  The camera helps you align each shot by showing a bit of the previous shot on the LCD  Very effective and stunning results b Superb for newbies and enthusiasts alike   Many who are new to digicams would probably be happy enough with the Auto mode but if you are keen on learning more about photography techniques  this digicam  either A60 or A70  is the best budget choice  Unlike a 35mm manual camera or SLR  you don 146t have to be afraid of wasting film when experimenting with the various shooting modes and settings  I took photos of things around the house at various aperture settings and the results are great  I used a large aperture such as F2 8 to make the background blur out when taking a macro shot of a flower and a small aperture such as F8 to make everything including the background look sharp   At F8  a tripod is recommended as slow shutter speeds are sometimes needed especially when the day is cloudy or dark  If I didn 146t like any picture  I simply deleted it and started over again  No more wasted 35mm film and money wasted into developing a whole roll just to get one or two useable photos   Good range of shutter speeds  Another main reason why I got this camera is because of its wide range of shutter speeds  Its slow speeds range up to 15 seconds  perfect for taking night scene shots  You can also choose  digital film  sensitivity from ISO 50 to ISO 400  Anything slower than 1 3 seconds shutter speed will kick in the automatic noise reduction  For those of you who don 146t understand what this is  let me try to explain  When taking long exposure shots  noise  the stuff that makes your film look old and grainy  is almost always introduced into your pictures  This becomes much more severe at higher sensitivities such as ISO 400  The camera employs an automatic noise reduction system to reduce this effect at slow shutter speeds  I took a 15 second night shot  no moon  just stars and some distant city lights  at ISO 50 and the result was almost noise free  Needless to say  I am much impressed   Movie mode   Movies are recorded with sound  In my opinion  movie modes on digicams are more like gimmicks than practical tools  They do however  provide a great way to capture small movie files for emailing to friends  especially after being edited and compressed with Windows Movie Maker or other editing software  The camera records movies at 15 frames per second and the sound is monaural  I ve only used it twice to record small videos of the kids playing  A real amusement for the kiddies b Battery life   I am still on the original bundled Panasonic alkalines at the time of writing this  after taking dozens of high quality pictures with LCD on and average flash usage  I am extremely impressed by its energy efficiency  However  I recommend a set of rechargeable high capacity NiMH batteries  Personally  I use Energizer 1700 mAh batteries  Overall  I have to say that battery life on this Canon is simply excellent since I also used the LCD many times and for reviewing and making many manual mode settings and changes as well as connected it to my laptop for downloading b Software   Windows XP and MAC OS users will find that the camera is automatically configured for and useable without installing any of Canon 146s bundled software  However  for more options and control  Canon 146s Zoom browser offers great versatility  I still prefer ACDSee for cataloguing and browsing photo collections though  Canon includes ArcSoft 146s Photo and Video Impressions software for making quick adjustments and editing of photos and videos  Far from the best but adequate for newbies  I find Photo Impressions difficult and impractical to use with annoying button sound effects that can 146t be turned off  or I haven 146t found out how  Adobe Photoshop Elements  a toned down version of Photoshop  would have been an excellent bundled choice instead   The badside   I only have one major complaint and that is the flash does a terrible job throttling down for macro shots  macros are taken at distances as close as 5cm or 2 inches  Macros at 5 cm with auto flash results in unuseable overexposed pictures  This is where the manual exposure control comes in real handy  For example  I experimented by taking a close up shot of the keys on a calculator at 5 cm  2 inches  range  On auto mode  the flash was fired and the picture was badly overexposed  So I switched to manual mode and set the shutter speed at 1 200 and aperture at F2 8 and voila  a perfect natural lighting shot  The calculator keys were perfectly exposed  all the letters were legible and clear and details extremely good  right down to the tiny scratches on the calculator surface  If you shoot at high resolutions  you can crop away certain parts of your macro shot to produce a great close up shot without loss of detail or pixilation  And as mentioned earlier  the camera 146s pictures are just a bit soft but this can be sharpened through software editing  And a small gripe  its CF card compartment cover is very flimsy  just waiting to break off  Other than these  I have no other major complains   Highly recommended   I highly recommend this camera  either model is good depending on your resolution needs  The camera is made in Malaysia  not in Japan  which probably helps to reduce its cost  It also has a plastic body  with only a metal front panel  It allows for further creativity by accepting add on macro and telephoto lenses and filters  There is also a waterproof casing available for it  No soft case is included in the box  so be sure to get one  I got one for free  the dealer threw one in for free when I complained that none was included  The case is specifically made for the A60 and A70 and is of a soft suede like material with good cushioning to protect the camera from small bumps and scratches   In conclusion 133  So what else can I say  I am very happy with my  280 purchase  You can get it for cheaper at some online stores so do shop around  It 146s a great camera and I have never enjoyed taking photos as much until now  The camera will keep both point and shooters and enthusiasts happy indeed  especially those on a budget  The softness in photos doesn 146t bother me much  it really isn 146t that bad  the photos are still very beautiful  but it might to some others  If this is the case  then you would have to move into the mid level Canon S45 which does offer sharper pictures but cost a lot more  If you have lots of money to burn  and want a high quality small compact sized camera  look at the S45  Nevertheless  I have no regrets getting this A60 model and buying a larger 128 MB CF card  rechargeable batteries and charger with the money saved These Canon cameras come closer and closer to the prosumer  professional consumer  G2s and newer G3s  but are heavy and bulky  in terms of features  On a scale  I think the A60 and A70 are at the low budget end  while the S45 sits in the middle and the G3 at the top  The A60 and A70 cameras are a great move by Canon  making many advanced manual controls available to the masses without unlimited cash  Kudos to Canon b This is how I would rate it b Features  5 stars Performance  4 stars Ergonomics and Build quality  4 stars Battery life  5 stars Value for money  5 stars This camera isn 146t perfect or doesn 146t have any flaws  but at this price  it has way more pros than cons so it rightfully earns its 5 star rating  
Camera, We bought the Sony MVC FD88 for our business pictures but it has become an item we use almost everyday  We thought at first that the price was high but we have more than paid for it in picture developing savings and ease of transferring to the computer  No more scanning  We have found the camera simple to use and very economical to operate  With grandchildren the options are endless  No more dull still pictures  a 5 to 10 second Video clip to friends and family says it all  This camera can be set to shoot in several light settings The only thing we can say bad about it is that it doesn t have the ability to rapid shoot so you miss some rapidly occurring  quot Picture perfect Moments quot  however with view screen you don t lose any pictures because you don t know what you have until the pictures are developed I don t know of anyone who this camera would not be a benefit to  Business to young families and grandparents br br  
Auto, I purchased a 1999 Rodeo LX in May 0f 99  It is our second one in 4 years  The previous one was involved in a low speed accident and the front end folded like a tin can and the air bag did not deploy  However we still purchased a new one in May  99  The new one had alot of new features that sold us  The split rear seat is a simple way to cart longer than normal items without losing the entire seat  I just wish there was a hook for a child seat tether strap on the rear floorboard for better securing  With the 15 quot  tires the spare is mounted under the chasis which drastically improves your rear vision  The new dash layout is user friendly and controls are clear and large  Pick up is great for a 6 cyl  SUV  gas mileage is not that great  I have found out that i get better gas mileage on regular gas instead of Super  All in all it is a great truck for the money  It handles well on and off road  the push button 4 wheel drive is clear and simple to operate  The seats are comfy and sound system is above average  I would recommend this truck for the mid size family looking for an affordable SUV br br  
Camera, I bought this camera at Wal mart for  179 99 for our home personal use  As we were doing our  early   the week before Christmas  I decided hide the wish list for a couple minutes and browse the electronics department  I ve been wanting a digital camera for several months now  If you re like me you have about twenty rolls of film still waiting to be developed  I researched all I could using the limited amount of information that they have beside the price tags  I picked up a few and held them as if I were to take a picture  After I picked up the ones that were completely out of my price range and then I stumbled upon the Polaroid PDC 700  I was amazed how it felt in my hand  I looked through the viewfinder  It is smaller than I d like but hey  when you ve got a 1 8  LCD screen at your disposal who needs a viewfinder  There also is an LCD screen on top of the unit that tells you approximately how many exposures are left  what flash setting the camera is on  the battery life  and the mode of resolution selected  I noticed many features that I liked  It has 4MB of internal memory able to hold between 12 and 90 photos depending on what quality you desire  This camera will also stamp the time date on the photo  It does accept CompactFlash cards up 32MB  The buttons are small and identified by icons and abbreviations rather than clearly labeled English making it hard to get used to  It has two different lens settings for those up close shots  auto focus  and a built in flash with an adjustable auto white feature  The flash can be set to three different settings  Auto  Always On  or Off  Although it lacks red eye reduction we don t seem to get that much any how  It came with many things other cameras don t  The Olympus camera I liked didn t come with the  30 AC adapter  It has a 10 second self timer  It is also tri pod mountable  The carrying case is perfect for this camera  I firmly holds this camera  It doesn t jar around like one you d have to buy if you bought a different model  The menu on the camera has many useful options  You can also use this camera for a webcam if you can capture the video from the LCD screen on the back  I did this by plugging the cameras included video cord into a VCR I have hooked up to my PC  The VCR is then connected to my PC via ATi TV Wonder card I bought for approximately  40  Some video cards have this built on  This camera consumes batteries like crazy so we purchased some NiMH batteries and a charger after blowing  9 00 worth of Duracell Ultra batteries in about a week  The picture quality is good if you want pictures to email and use primarily for your computer  I ve found that the shots I took outside are truely awesome  They look just like a 35mm 4x6 picture  But the pictures I took inside especially when I turned the flash off looked somewhat  grainy  although still bright  Overall I would recommend this camera to people who want to spend less than  250 because you get so many extras  It comes with two different software programs although one is kind of  kiddyish  a USB cable  that really zips those photos on your pc  a serial cable  a video cable to connect to a television or VCR  AC adapter  4 AA Duracell Ultra batteries  good for about 50 60 shots if using the LCD as the primary viewfinder  a leather carrying case  a wrist strap  and a Quick Start Guide  The driver supplied included TWAIN compliant driver which allows you to download pictures of the camera using most other programs like MGI Photosuite  etc  There isn t any real users manual  They are all in a file  And the website doesn t seem built for any support  For your own research  http www polaroid com products digital imaging digital cameras pdc700 index html We ve taken over 250 photos now  I feel we ve spent as little as we could without sacrificing a decent quality photo  
Auto, The new  2000 Ford Mustang is a great car  It is good looking  handles quite well  gets great gas mileage  it is fun to drive  and to my great surprise  it was very affordable The interior is quite comfortable  it has both driver  and passenger side airbags  and even though the trunk opening is rather small  the trunk space itself is immense I was pleasantly surprised that the Mustang came with both cassette and CD players  It is nice to have a media option The only drawback that I found with the Mustang is the back seat leg room  it is almost non existent  If you have more than two people riding in the car  it might get a little cramped br br  
Auto, We bought our 2001 Avalon XLS in Summer 2001 and love it  It s loaded with all the bells and whistles  option package  7  aka  the kitchen sink  sunroof  traction control  heated seats  etc  Haven t yet located the button for the automatic back scratchers  I m sure I ll find it some day Given that I m extremely happy with the car  I ll focus my comments on what s not so good The trip computer  w  computation of fuel economy  elapsed time  etc  is rendered virtually useless by the fact that it is automatically reset each time the ignition is switched off this is my biggest complaint with the car  And there is no control  that I know of  to change this setting Our car was delivered out of alignment  the dealer rectified that at no charge  However  alignment has continued to be somewhat of an issue I have found that the car is very sensitive to front wheel tire inflation   I will admit  however  to being a bit obsessive  compulsive with regards to alignment and others many not be as particular as I Audio controls on the steering wheel would be nice We have found the traction control to be great and combined with the anti lock brakes  the car handles very well in slushy weather The automatic headlights turn on a bit too late  i e  after it is a little too dark  the manual says that this can be adjusted by the dealer  but the guy I talked to at my service department didn t know anything about it  Admittedly  however  he was no candidate for Mensa The low fuel light on my Avalon is useless  It never seemed to come on  leading me to suspect that it was broken  To test this  I decided to drive my car to as close to empty as possible  tempting fate in a stubborn test of wills with the tiny dashboard bulb   I usually fill up once I dip below a   tank  The low fuel warning light finally lit when the trip computer indicated we had only 14 miles to go until my wife had to get out and push us into the nearest gas station  The low fuel light had finally sent it 146s notice with less than half a gallon in the tank  This isn 146t a warning it 146s a lonely  final gasp of thirst If you 146re looking for a  147performance 148 sedan  the Avalon isn 146t it  It 146s plenty fast and handles well  but the Acura TL is sportier  but much more cramped  We looked at the Maxima  but it seemed cheap and tacky  And the Avalon  a sedate car in its on right  has the panache of a Rolls Royce compared to the coma inducing Accord and Camry  We thought about a Volvo  but we didn 146t like the 5 cylinder engine and their quality ratings have plummeted in recent years  something to which my next door neighbor can attest as his new Volvo S80 has been back to the dealer numerous times  A good friend recently bought a BMW 3 series  it 146s tiny compared to our Avalon  isn 146t nearly as comfortable  and cost thousands more  Granted  the Beemer is faster and more of a performance car  but I think she got raked over the coals  Maybe I 146m beyond my years  I 146m 35  but I 146m more interested in comfort than speed  The car ads on TV show beautiful people driving their cars on empty  winding roads at 80  MPH  But I don 146t live in a car ad  I 146m not beautiful  the roads I drive are filled with yahoos  and if I was lucky enough to rev it up to 80 I d have a state trooper on me like a dog on a porkchop  Given this context  I find the Avalon to be a very comfortable and very capable performer We looked at American cars and without exception  we thought they were just absolute junk  Other than selling a Buick Park Avenue to my father in law every 12 years  I don 146t know how GM stays in business  The Avalon has the perfect mix of quality  comfort  and performance that we were looking for  
Camera, Picked this up at Staples for  299 w  free HP 3200C scanner AND 15Mb memory card as bonuses  I based the decision on the great reviews that the C30 was getting  e g  see CNET  Apparently the C200 is the follow on to the C 30 w  lower price and better SW Overall  I figure any megapixel camera for under  300 is a deal   especially with these bonuses  After about 350 photos here are my observations The C 200 is extremely easy to use w  autofocus  autoflash  autoexposure all working effectively to deliver high quality photos  Generally  the intermediate resolution  get 75 of these w  my bonus 15mb memory card   but 8mb is standard  is sufficient for most normal photo situations  Exceptions would be landscapes  aerial photos or photos which are going to be cropped or printed to sizes over 8x10  This camera could be used by just about anyone since it s point and shoot  The lack of many manual overrides could frustrate professionals however  I do not use the LCD to frame photos   preferring the optical viewfinder  Using the camera that way  the batteries seem to last almost forever  I ve taken over 300 photos   most w  flash and the original batteries still report half charge  I generally shoot in intermediate resolution mode  Note that this observation does not match some of the other reviews that have been written  This implies that other users have been using the LCD unnecessarily  So  if you want long battery life use the viewfinder and minimize use of the LCD  I use the LCD for short bursts to review photos and erase the camera  That s about it Serial connection to the camera is slow   expect it to take about 30 seconds to transfer each photo  For  15  I picked up a PCMCIA adapter for the SmartMedia card which makes the transfers virtually instantaneous and works fine even on Windows 2000  RC3  Using this adapter  the images on the memory card appear as jpg files on a removable media device  My frustrations are that the camera is boxy  It s too big for a shirt pocket and uncomfortable in your pants pockets  Generally  you will want to carry it in a jacket pocket or around your neck w  the included strap  Also  it lacks optical zoom  big surprise for  lt 300 right  The digital zoom must be invoked through the LCD  batteries  so I don t use it Generally  this is a very satisfactory camera and a great value br br  
Auto, I have owned an Extended 4 Dr Montana for 2 years now  It is great on the highway for ride and gas mileage  26mpg  It has had only minor problems thus far  The original OEM tires are not the best  but they are okay  Stopping distances are too long  but the handling is nimble with good engine performance to add  Unfortunately  there is noticeable torque steer during hard acceleration that takes some getting used to  The integrated child seat is the best  It is easy to use  safe and does not make the kids seem confined  One noticeable complaint is interior cabin noise is louder than some competitors  Also  the cabin air filter is rather pricey to replace    65 for parts  Suggested to be replaced annually  
Auto,   Different or an Old Trend    The  147Honda Element 148 is not what you would call a new design  It is different yes  there 146s no arguing that  But is it in fact a new design that Honda came up as an original that they could call their own  Well  not quite  If you thought thoroughly about the  147Honda Element 146s 148 structure you would notice the fact that the  147Honda Element 148 is indeed an old trend coming back  About fifty sixty years ago  give or take  the primary structure of most cars was boxy  Boxy frame  boxy lights if you 146re getting it  it 146s not a completely original design  Why do you need to know this  Well in my own opinion  I think it was a small mistake on  147Honda 146s 148 part for the car they made  They created a cars image that was an image of almost all cars some years ago  But that style died  and for a reason I would guess because 133those cars weren 146t all that sharp  Meaning that  147Honda 148 did this just to put a car out there  They make a car that has an old trend  but they don 146t even make a single thing about the car special or unique in any way  Just to clear that up  and I heard a rumor from somewhere that the Honda Element in fact was designed following the prints of a old milk truck 133weird b  Questions that will be answered   i What is the MSRP for a 4WD EX Honda Element  highest model i i How does the car handle i i What options are available i i What caliber of safety is this car of i i Will this car last is this car a worth while investment i i Is this car fit for me and my mid sized family i b  Handling   Handling is what you would expect of a car of this size  I turned  stopped  went and parked  Truly I couldn 146t find anything special than that of the Honda Civic  The only thing that did shine was the four wheel drive  it started better and it seemed to pull itself up hills effortlessly  Also  I have lived in numerous states of varying climates on the east coast  And I can tell you by personal experience  it is a good thing to own a 4 wheel drive car when a blizzard rolls in  specifically Pennsylvania  However the handling is not quite affected by the 4 wheel drive as much as you would think  You DO NOT stop better  turning is not affected to a point you could notice and the car doesn 146t park tighter or is easier to maneuver  Of course  4 wheel drive doesn 146t make you godlike so if you don 146t need 4 wheel drive  save some cash and go a different direction Driving the  147Honda Element 148 is like a mix from driving something as a go kart  extremely maneuverable  and very easy to control and responsive  or a Hummer  bulky  heavy  not as responsive  or something that can start and stop as quick  So in the middle would be the Honda Element  Excellent starting  good stopping  good turning  great parking  fairly maneuverable and quite responsive Handling is what makes this car a worthwhile burden to let a good 20 000 dollars out your pocket  Great in all categories  and starts very well if you are purchasing the 4 wheel drive EX DX b  The Interior Comfort and the Others   I must say  it is a beautiful interior  especially with black leather seats and a silver dash board  It 146s a very modernized interior and I greatly approved of it  The dashboard  the instrument panels and gauges were placed very well  If anything I would praise Honda for their work on the interior of the Honda Element  And if you pick the EX with the proper accessories and options  the Element 146s interior is a thing of beauty  Except the flaw of comfort 133 i Comfort   Well  just because it 146s nice looking  doesn 146t mean it has to be comfortable  And in this case  it couldn 146t be anymore true  After a few minutes of sitting in the driver 146s seat  the seat that should be made with the most comfort since the driver is the driver  my butt was friggin 146 soar  I would shift from side to side to help  but the seats are just way to stiff Whether I was spoiled from more comfortable leather seats I don 146t know  All I know is the Honda Elements seats could have been more comfortable  and definitely would have been better if they actually were more comfortable  I can 146t find a huge difference with the fabric and leather  But I think I can feel the fabric absorb slightly more therefore being softer  and more comfortable i Others   Well  there are some attractive catches that come with the Honda Element  Such as the complete folding seats  front and back  why you would ever want to fold all the seats down I don 146t know  but it 146s cool right because it 146s there and you can go ahead and do it for fun And then there is the folding out doors  a new thing Honda has done  which open out in opposite ways  What does this do  It does 133nothing  it might save some space of clearance between the front and back seats  and it allows you to open the entire car for yourself if you were planning to vacuum it  or have it inspected  whatever you want b Engine Mileage  I fought myself wondering whether or not I should mention the engines power  because if you were even interested in purchasing this car the last thing you would have considered would be the engine  But hey  it would be nice for you to have a vague peek at what the Honda Element 146s engine can provide so 133it 146s your average sized 6 cylinder engine  maybe a little smaller than a normal 6 cylinder engine because it is 2 4 liters  displacement  and I was surprised to find out the Honda Element was not a weak engine  It just wasn 146t special with it 146s fair torque and 160 horse engine  From looks alone you would think a car such as the Honda Element would be a weak sedan  but 133it 146s not  Checking my mileage with the Honda Element  I was getting a good 30 35miles per gallon  You can consider this good  since I drove about in the city with a lot of stop go traffic  Also to mention  this car is four wheel drive  Getting the two wheel drive model would raise you gas mileage considerably  but don 146t forget you 146ll be sacrificing control for distance Well the car is fair for it 146s gas mileage  but in the end it 146s just good  Because the car is most definitely not fuel conservative  or have a hybrid 4 cylinder engine  so don 146t expect to be amazed  You 146ll get best performance with this car if you live possibly in the country  flat land  don 146t have to much uneven land to navigate  or forced stops  traffic lights  intersections b  Safety   Safety is an extremely important factor in a car  especially one on the nimble side  I am glad to say that the Honda Element is fairly safe  with no awards  or 4 star awards  considering the way it was created If you notice the passenger driver side doors  you 146ll see that they open out with no reinforcements  it can make someone to wonder what a side impact would do to the car people inside  Well the car 146s doors are in fact very secure  When you close the doors steel beams inside the doors lock together  go ahead and try to nudge them open or try and pull to make them sway  Hondas employees will let you do as you please if you feel the need to prove something to yourself  and you are willing to buy it if you break it Then there are some safety features that are most definitely found in all cars of good quality  Such as the four wheel anti lock ABS brakes  and brake turning assists  all so vague that you would never know it was there unless someone was to take it away  In my opinion  all good cars have this  and Honda has made a good car that is safe enough to sustain damage  while being versatile enough to never have to be in that situation   By the way  don 146t be cheap  get the front side airbags and all that I mentioned  since all of it is an added safety option i  Options      4WD Automatic Transmission Front Side Airbags  Nighthawk Black Pearl Exterior  Side Steps  Door Visor  Sunroof  Security System  Fog Lamps  Wear Tough Floor Mats  Burnt Black Leather Seats  Black Interior  Powered Windows  AM FM and CD Player  Air Conditioning   147Most of the things mentioned were completely optional  while others were your average package that would come with the car 148  These are not my options  but the options of the car I test drove to see what the element was all about MSRP    22 138  Not bad for a car that seats four b  Wrap Up   To make it simple  there is always some specific part of a car or trait that makes it stand out  a Hummer is big  a Yugo is crappy  and a MINI is small and fuel efficient  As far as the Honda Element goes  the master trait would be cargo space  For such a small car  the cargo space is unbeatable  It is just about as big as any SUV trunk  and definitely bigger than any SUV trunk that has a third row of seats hogging room So there you have it  the Honda Element  an amazingly average car  Made by the people at Honda who were trying to think outside the box 133but all they did was make a box I hope you enjoyed this review  and that it will be useful to you at sometime place

Auto, I am a single parent and need a reliable car for transportation of the children to school and myself to work  I am on my third Toyota  my second Camry  The Camry is definately reliable  dependable and seems to run forever on a tank of gas  My Camry is 4 cylinder and the ride is a little rough  however  I have driven the V6 and it has a smooth  quiet ride and lots of power  The front seats are really comfortable for extended trips  The cooling system can really crank it out to fight our 100  degree summers here in Texas  This 4 cylinder of mine is zippy  handles extremely well and the ABS braking system is great  Mine has kept me from sliding many times  Another great thing I love about my Toyotas is this  I am a large woman  and I understand from talking to some of my large women friends that some of the other car manufacturers  seat belts do not fit  Some will provide an  extender  either free or at a small charge  Saturn has small belts and will not make nor provide extenders for larger people  Well  we can take our money elsewhere and purchase a car from a manufacturer who understands that  one size fits all  is a lie  I have had a Toyota Tercel  a Toyota Camry station wagon  and now my Camry LE and even for a big woman  there is ample room in the seat belt  I highly recommend this car br br  
Camera, First of all  let me say I had never even held a digital camera until my Ricoh RDC 6000 arrived at 3 00 pm one afternoon  By 4 30 pm I was emailing pictures of the cats to my husband at work  Within 24 hours I had 70 pictures of Vacation Bible School up on the Internet for the parents to see  It just doesn t get much easier than this  Now  let me back up a little  When I first opened the box and saw all the cables and books  I thought   I can t wait for my husband to get home to figure this out  As I started handling the camera and looking at the literature  I thought  Well  at least I can get the battery charged before Ted gets home  Can you see where this is going  Instead of trying to figure out everything at once I just kept solving little  how to  problems and the next thing you know  I had taken a picture of the box the camera came in The Ricoh RDC 6000 can be overwhelming when you first open the box  There is so much more than just a camera in there  In addition to the camera I found Cable for USB Connection Cable for Serial Connection Cable for Television Connection AC Adapter Power cord for AC Adapter Rechargeable Battery 8 MB SmartMedia Memory Card Converter Cable for Round Serial Port  I think that s what it is Camera Case Camera Strap Operation Manual Software Manual Battery Manual  the battery has its own manual Software CD for Windows Software CD for Macs Registration Questionnaire Technical Service Document A packet of offers and advertisements Fifteen minutes after opening the box I had all these parts and manuals and documents spread out on my kitchen table  I attached the strap  inserted the battery  and plugged in the AC adapter  Since I could turn the camera on now and I did not have to wait until the battery was fully charged  I thought I d take a few pictures  A quick glance at the operation manual  I found the large dial on the top of the camera  turned it to picture taking mode and snapped away  Another check of the manual  I turned the dial to playback mode  and scrolled through the pictures I had just taken  There was no stopping me now  I turned that dial one more time to delete mode and started over  After a few minutes of this I wanted to email the pictures to my husband so I got the software manual and the Windows CD  Following the very simple instructions I installed the USB driver  the Ricoh Camera Utility and a photo editing software called ArcSoft  I attached the USP cable to the computer and the camera  turned that large dial on top of the camera to PC mode  opened the Ricoh utility and followed the directions  I now had  jpg files on my hard drive  Just treat these as you would any other  jpg file  You can use photo editing software to edit them  attach them to email  upload them to various photo storing websites  whatever you fancy  Since I wanted to take pictures of Vacation Bible School the next day  it was now time to figure out more of the bells and whistles of this camera  Since many of you will find all the details boring  or even incomprehensible  they are at the end of this review and can safely be skipped without losing the sense of this Epinion b What I really like about this camera  Using the 8 MB SmartMedia card that the camera comes with and setting it to 640 X 480 Normal  I can take 99 pictures and the quality is good enough to get 4  X 6  prints  The camera takes SmartMedia cards up to 64 MB and in 640 X 480 Economy that would be 1 690 pictures   on one card   but probably only good for wallet sized prints  It is also possible to set this camera to take pictures at 2000 X 1480 pixels  In this case  you d get 5 pictures on an 8 MB SmartMedia card or 43 pictures on a 64 MB SmartMedia card and could probably get a good print at 10  X 13  Anyway you look at it  this was more pictures than I expected to be able to get on one SmartMedia card The Ricoh RDC 6000 is pocket sized at 4   X 2   X 1   It really isn t much bigger than my Kodak Advantix or any 35 mm camera I have owned The camera has many bells and whistles that I have yet to master including redeye reduction  playback to a TV  white balance  manual focus and focus lock  monochrome mode  protect from erasure  setting aperture priority  instead of automatic  changing ISO sensitivity  interval shooting  and using an optional remote control unit  I am most definitely an amateur photographer and anything that can be set to  automatic  is set to  automatic  so much of these extras will go unused by me Much of the camera is intuitive  I managed to set the date and time without ever looking at the manual  The menus on the LCD monitor are logical and easy to follow  I was up and running in just over an hour  and I had a problem installing the software that had nothing to do with Ricoh that took me 30 minutes to fix The outdoor shots came out incredible  That may have something to do with the sun  the blue skies  and the total lack of clouds we have here in Lubbock  But I got one picture of balloons floating in the sky that shows so much detail I can hardly believe I took it b What I don t like about this camera  The operation manual was translated from Japanese  Page 19 instructs you to charge the batteries  plural  before loading but on page 27  it is obvious you have to load the battery  there is only one  in order to charge it The slot for the SmartMedia Card has a cover that cannot be opened with your fingernail  I need a knife or nail file to get this opened  Maybe it needs to be broken in but right now it is tough to open The flash cannot be used while taking motion pictures The camera case that comes with this camera holds only the camera and a SmartMedia card  There is no place to store the battery in this camera case and the manual recommends removing the battery to store the camera   What I haven t decided on yet  I took 40 pictures indoors with a flash before I needed to recharge the battery  In that time I played back all of them to check for quality and deleted about 5 pictures  After the 40 pictures  I became tethered to an outlet to finish taking pictures that morning  For most projects  that s probably enough charge to take a sufficient number of pictures  But I guess I was excited about my new camera and went crazy taking pictures b Most of the Important Details  Can be safely skipped unless you are serious about buying this camera The large dial on the top has a total of six modes Set Mode   Let s you format the SmartMedia card  set the date or language  and various other functions of the camera Movie Mode   Allows you to take short movie pictures as AVI files Still Mode   Allows you to take snap shots Review Mode   Allows you to see the movies or pictures you have taken Delete Mode   Can erase one or more of the files on the camera PC Mode   for transferring files to the PC Also on top of the camera are three buttons for flash  timer  and image quality and a small LCD panel  The flash can be always on  always off  automatic  or slow synchronized for indoor use  The self timer allows for a 10 second delay between pressing the shutter release button and actually taking the picture  There are nine image quality settings ranging from 1600 X 1200 Fine to 640 X 480 Economy  The LCD panel has readouts on flash mode  self timer  picture quality  battery power  redeye reduction  and recording mode  still or movie In addition to the power button  the back of the camera has six other buttons and an LCD monitor  Two buttons with up and down arrows let you scroll through the menus and the files  pictures  and allow you to zoom in from 1X to 2X to 3X to 4X  The display button changes the LCD monitor display turning it off and on  to save batteries while the camera stays on  or changes the display from one picture to six pictures  The CANCEL  ENTER and MENU buttons are used with the various menus in the various modes and are really self explanatory once you are in a certain mode  The LCD monitor is where you find all the important information like date  time  number of pictures on the SmartMedia card  approximate number of pictures left to take  zoom level  flash mode  and focus mode The bottom of the camera had a tripod screw hole and a dial to adjust the brightness on the LCD monitor b Results and Recommendations  I have uploaded pictures from the camera to my computer to a photo hosting web site and they really are very good  I am no great photographer but the parents of the kids at Vacation Bible School were impressed  Total time from camera to web site was about 20 minutes  Later  I went back to my files and edited about 20 of the pictures that were too dark or too light  using Microsoft Photo Editor software  and uploaded the new pictures to the web site  That took about 20 minutes for editing and uploading  I took a few pictures in each of the zoom modes  1X through 4X  and they seem to be as good as any other picture I took  I printed a few pictures  640 X 480 Normal quality  at about 5  X 7  on regular  not photo  paper and they are acceptable  They are group shots and people are recognizable  The recommended maximum size for this quality is 4  X 6 I have taken one motion picture  uploaded the AVI file  and viewed it just to see how it worked  It was quite simple  Press the shutter release to start recording  press it again to stop  Upload using the same Ricoh utility that is used for stills  So far  I have taken advantage of one offer that came with the camera  I joined photoisland com and have received 75 MB of storage for pictures  I have not yet uploaded any pictures to them but 75 MB of storage will go a long way with only an 8 MB SmartMedia card  That s close to 900 pictures I could store on their site If you are new to digital cameras and would rather not start at the low end with a limited camera  I highly recommend the Ricoh RDC 6000  It is easy to use  most functions can be set to an automatic mode  and yet it is still capable of taking some very high quality pictures and videos  As you become a more advanced photographer  you can use more of the manual modes to take exactly the picture you want  And don t be overwhelmed by all the parts  cables  and papers that come in the box  It is very easy to sort out what exactly you need  
Camera, I needed a digital camera  but didn t want to spend a fortune  For  299 00 the Olympus D 340R filled the bill It s used for family photos  the grandchildren  special events and the like  Plus I use the camera to photograph items sold on Ebay and other on line sites  The manual covers all questions  it shoots great close ups of small items and takes the normal shots with ease  An electrical plug in unit saves battery use when using the camera in the home Software is provided to download the photos onto a computer  It s been used with a power mac and Dell windows 98 machine with a Flash Path device that fits in the floppy disc file It s my first experience with a digital camera and couldn t be happier with the system The only note  using the camera s rear photo window and flash wears the 4 AA batteries down rapidly when shooting large numbers of photos  Carry extra batteries  indoors use the AC adapter br br  
Auto, My husband and I bought our Jeep in Oct  but instead of a new one  we bought a 1998 model  Price wasn t really our main concern  My reason for wanting the 1998 model  was the that the new ones have a rounded front end  and I prefer the more  quot boxy quot  look  Our Jeep had 28K miles on it when we bought it  and it now has about 34 500 on it  I ve never had a problem with it  It drives smoothly with minimal road noise  and steers easily  It has what is referred to as a  quot straight 6 quot  vs  a V6  As we were negotiating with the dealer  we notice some paint problems with the hood  It looked like tiny little cracked areas  We pointed this out to our salesman  and he had the body man look at it  They decided that it was a factory defect  and repainted our hood with no fuss at all  The paint job looks great  and perfectly matches the rest of the vehicle  I also like the interior  It s charcoal velour  and very comfortable  Overall  we are extremely happy with our purchase  I d recommend a Jeep to anyone shopping for an SUV br br  
Camera, The first thing you ll notice about the Fuji MX 1700 is it s size its  not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes But don t let the small size fool you  This mid priced model takes pictures whose quality rival those of larger clunkier  and more expensive  2 megapixel cameras This camera has many features to admire  such as a true 3X optical zoom  as well as a 2X digital zoom  The controls are well laid out  and convenient to use  Special features such as flash settings  such as red eye and delay and macro have their own buttons  making them much easier to use than similar features on cameras that make you scroll through endless menus when you want to change the settings The lithium ion batteries that this camera uses are both a blessing and curse  On the one hand  these batteries charge right in the camera  with the included charger cord  and are much smaller than 4 AA batteries  which helps keep the camera portable  On the other hand their small size gives them a bit let juice  which means that you should probably keep a spare charged up for emergency swaps If this camera has any drawback  it would be its uneven low light performance  I ve seen some other digital cameras  like some of the Olympus models  that provide more consistent results when indoors under low light conditions  With the MX 1700  you won t always get top quality pictures indoors  though in most cases  they are at least satisfactory Of course  staying at home shooting pictures isn t the point of this camera  If you re looking for a great digital camera that you can just slip into your pocket when you are on the go  that combines moderate price with great 2 megapixel performance  you won t find a better choice than the Fuji MX 1700 br br  
Camera, At the beginning of the summer I decided to purchace a digital Camera  I purchaced the 318 from OfficeMax for  200  This product is now far cheaper  probably retailing for around  150 First  let s go over some specifications  This is a 2 3 megapixel digital camera  It has a 2x digital zoom  flash  1 5   approximate  LCD display  8 megabytes of onboard memory  and a compact flash card slot  Using the camera is a snap  To take a picture  simply turn the unit on  look through the viewfinder  depress the shutter button a little bit so the unit can focus  then press it all the way  and it will snap the picture  The camera displays the photo in the LCD display as it is saved to memory  Speaking of memory  you will want to buy a memory card  The onboard 8 megabytes will hold about 7 highest quality photos  while a 32 megabyte card will hold almost 30 high quality images  Of course  the camera can hold many  many more images at the lower quality settings   There are only 3 quality settings  unlike the Cannon I used which had several  Some may like the simplification  some may not  I don t mind it  With the 64 megabyte card I purchaced  the camera can take 70 high quality pictures  120 medium  and almost 1 000 low quality  800x600  pictures Once you ve taken the pictures  looking at them is a snap  Just push in the wheel at the top of the camera  and turn the wheel  like the wheel at the top of a mouse  to view the images  You can create a digital print order form  delete images  view thumbnails  or get into the camera setup via this area  Navigation is extremely easy and straightforward  Someone doesn t need to be skilled at computers or photography to use this camera For the price  the photo quality is excellent  The highest quality setting will give you nice 5x7 prints  but going higher then that when printing will degrade quality  A word about batteries  I use NI MH batteries  but the camera accepts four standard AA batteries  I reccomend getting a few NIMH batteries and a charger to save money  and the environment Of course  there are a few  issues  I ve encountered with the camera GRIPE 1  SLOW SAVING  The camera takes between 1 and 4 seconds between shots to save the image it just took  When taking a lot of pictures  this delay becomes irritating after awhile GRIPE 2  FEW BELLS AND WHISTLES  The camera comes with a 2x zoom  10 second timer  quality settings  flash options  auto  red eye  forced flash  no flash  a screen to use as a viewfinder and picture viewer  a normal viewfiner  and a Compact Flash slot  That s about it  I wish it had more options  like moving pictures around  stamping a date  etcetera GRIPE 3  MACRO PHOTOS  I do some nature photography that requires close ups  Unfortunately  the camera cannot do this very well  The closest it can focus is about 5 inches from the subject  However  this shouldn t cause problems for most users GRIPE 4  USB TRANSFERS  Sending photos to the computer through the USB port is SLOW  I m not sure why this is  It takes about 8 minutes to send 64 megabytes of data to the computer from the camera CONCLUSION Overall  this is a very nice little camera  However  someone who s vying to become a professional photographer won t like this camera a lot  But  for the moms and dads out there  students  or business men and women  this camera should make you happy  
Camera, My wife bought me this camera a few weeks before our baby was born so that we could instantly share pictures of our first born to family that is spread throughout the country  She knows my penchant for researching all purchases  so presented me with the  quot O K quot  to go buy one after doing my research So  to the internet  epinions of course  and to a local camera store  Camera World  I went  Why did I end up with the   Fuji FinePix 1400 i b  Price  functionality and quality b Price  Retail for the FinePix 1400 is  290  but I found it at the Chase Manhattan shopping site for  190  Even with a couple of upgrades  32MB Flash Card  8 rechargeable batteries and a charger  my price was still under the retail price  My wife had put me on a  300 budget  so this was perfect for me  I found that digital cameras run in the  200    900 range  I was very surprised that my  190 bought such a fine camera b Features  The Fuji FinePix 1400 comes standard with the following i 3x Autofocus Power Zoom    Perfectly fine for any indoor household type zooming needs  Not great for trying to zoom in on a wide receiver on a football field  however i 4MB SmartMedia Storage Card    This only holds about 15 or 18 pictures  so unless you download pictures after every picture taking session  you ll want to upgrade this to a 32MB version  You can find a 32MB Card for about  50 on eBay  and this will hold about 150 pictures  More than enough to get you through several photo sessions i 1280 x 960 Image File Resolution    Good resolution for pictures up to 5x7  If you re interested in blowing your pictures up to 8x10 or larger  I d recommend a camera with a higher resolution  However  I m perfectly happy with the FinePix s resolution for my everyday internet sharing purposes  I have developed one of the pictures in 8x10 format  and although it looks good from a distance  you can really see the pixels up close i 1 6 inch Liquid Crystal Display    Awesome  You take a picture and 1 2 second later it is shown on this incredibly sharp display  Not only that  but you can choose to view from this so you can take pictures without having your eye directly on the viewfinder  It s like a little video camera  but not recording  When viewing a picture  you can zoom in and out and the display exposes new levels of detail upon each closer zoom   Multi Frame Playback Feature    Lots and lots of options on how to view pictures  One by one  thumbnails  zoomed in  zoomed out  etc  You can also lock photos so they aren t inadvertently deleted  Navigating through the pictures is very easy  and the buttons to do so are clearly marked and large enough to accommodate large fingers i USB enabled    This is very important to get  Do not buy serial cable cameras  as it takes FOREVER to port to a computer  The USB cable is lightening fast  To view the 120 pictures on my camera right now  it only takes about 3 seconds for all to load  The software Fuji provides is simple to install and simple to use  Consists of a driver for Windows 98 or Windows 2000  a photo editor and a photo viewer  I ve never used the photo editor  however  because I m a fan of Microsoft s PhotoDraw 2000 Version 2 0  PhotoDraw has more than enough to alter enhance crop digital photographs b Batteries  Don t even think of using regular batteries with this camera  or any digital camera  The Liquid Crystal Display will eat through 4 AA batteries in a matter of minutes  You should invest in the  25 40 for a battery charger and nickel cadmium batteries  I suggest you buy 8 batteries so you always have a back up set handy  You can get a great deal on eBay for a package deal  charger and batteries  for about  35 usually b Conclusion  I m very happy with the Fuji FinePix 1400  I ve been able to share many pictures of my new son with my family over the internet  and even printed a bunch  through SnapFish com  to send with the birth announcement  We ve gotten nothing buy rave reviews  I feel like I got a quality  mid range camera for a low end price br br  
Camera, I was in my local camera shop a few days ago looking for a small carrying case for my new digital camera  I spend more time in photo and electronics stores than the average Canon representative  and I was chatting with a friendly salesman about digital cameras  I had barely noticed the middle aged man standing a few yards away staring blankly into a showcase  The salesman excused himself from our conversation  and went to proffer assistance to this gentleman  Our mystery man responded   quot No  thanks  but I d like to talk to YOU  if you don t mind quot  pointing a friendly finger in my direction  As it turned out  this stranger  Chris  he introduced himself  had just purchased the new Sony DSC F505V digital camera  and wanted to pay me  60 to spend 3 hours showing him how to use the camera  He turned out to be an ex wedding photographer  turned photo hobbyist who had just made his first foray into digital photography  As an avid photographer  I figured it would make for a good Epinions review  plus I can never turn down an offer to play with new technology  so off we went to the streets of New Jersey for a little photographic adventure  I also took my 3 month old Nikon Coolpix 990 with me to see how it would stand up to Sony s newest competitor  Chris pulled out his manual while I played with the controls  and by the time he had read over the first 3 pages  I had the camera figured out  This was not completely attributable to my camera skills  I must admit  Sony has done a nice job laying out the controls with good access to menus and fast access to basic functions  After spending what turned out to be 5 hours learning  teaching  and photographing with the DSC F505V  I can say that Sony came pretty close to producing a great camera Let s start with the Sony s strong points  The Carl Zeiss lens produces excellent results with great color saturation  The 5 times optical zoom provides great range  though it operates a little slowly  and makes it much more versatile in telephoto situations  up to the 35mm equivalent of 190mm  This digicam wins points in my book by including a good amount of creative control  and I love the manual focusing ring at the front of the lens  All was going well on our photo shoot when suddenly the digipoo hit the fan  Fifty minutes into the afternoon and already the freshly charged lithium ion battery was dead  Luckily he had the good sense to spend an additional  50 for a spare battery  but with a two hour charge time  Sony includes 1 battery and the charger  and less than an hour s operation  we had encountered the DSC F505V s first weakness  This flaw is worsened by the fact that you cannot use any other types of batteries in the unit  and since there is no viewfinder  there is no way of saving power by turning off the display  After another hour s use  some intense reading  of both the manual and some reviews  and uploading the images to a computer  other flaws began to surface  The included 8MB MemoryStick filled up very quickly  for  1000  Sony should have included a 16MB card  The manual is virtually impossible to follow  and the camera is a little too bulky for it s features  Flash performance was also a little below average  and I thought Sony should have included a more versatile set of metering options  center weighted and spot are your only choices  I also think that Sony slightly misrepresented the DSC F505V by advertising it as a 3 7 megapixel camera  What the camera actually does is use a 3 3 MP  2048x1536  CCD  which is partly blocked from the lens by the camera s design  This means the camera is only actually capturing 2 7 megapixels  1856x1392  What the camera then does  albeit better than some earlier digital cameras  is interpolate the image out to 2240 by 1680  creating a 3 7 megapixel image  This final image does not produce quite as good a result as true 3 34 megapixel camera When the second battery died  55 minutes out of this one  I showed Chris my Coolpix 990  check out my user page for a complete review  After an hour or so he had the basic functions down  and he was enamored with the Nikon s swivel head and control system  We talked about some of the obvious advantages  true 3 34 megapixel resolution  compact design  pro features  inclusion of a viewfinder  and the ability to use AA batteries  and it was a no brainer for him  Right then  we drove to the store where he bought the DSC F505V  and exchanged it for their second to last Nikon 990  I talked to him again several days later  and he was as thrilled with his new Coolpix as I was br br  
Auto, I bought the 2001 Integra GS Coupe  AT  back in January 2001  6 months before it is replaced by the all new RSX  It 146s the last of its generation  First of all  I have to admit that I should have waited for 6 more months and get an all new RSX at about same price or got a MT GSR Type R  nonetheless  I enjoy the ride of this car Since it is my first purchased vehicle and didn 146t drive much before  I didn 146t do much research on different models vendors  I did consider Toyota Celica  Mitsubishi Eclipse  Honda Accord Coupe  I didn 146t look at European vendor because my budget was just slightly more than  20K  plus I don 146t believe reliability on European cars  except Mercedez Benz  Celica and Eclipse were ruled out because of awkward styling and reliability respective while Accord Coupe is too  roomy  and too sedan style  The only sporty car left in my list was the legendary Integra  and given the reliability rating of Honda Acura  it was the best choice Exterior I love the styling  even better than the new RSX  It 146s has a traditional Japanese hot rod  sporty styling  but without over aggressive as Eclipse and Celica   Of course  Integra can have very aggressive exterior after all those after market body kits  Its smooth front end  with 4 round headlights gives an  intelligent  outlook  which is well received by young professionals  Though this exterior has been for Integra since 94  which was amazing back then  it still looks good nowadays  I won 146t say the styling is out dated  but rather a bit boring since there are so many Integras out there on the street  after 8 years in production Interior In general  I think the interior is what bring down the rating of this car  There is not much upgrade  except from cassette to CD player  since the 3rd generation of Integra came out in 94  It may be cool looking back then  but it 146s out dated after 8 years  The console is comparable to the Accord 2 generations back  The CD player is kind of hard to reach from driver seat and you need to lean a bit forward to reach the CD player  The dash board looks good though not excited  It 146s easy to read during day time even under bright sunlight  at night it looks ok as well don 146t see any reflection from the windshield  Thanks to the dash broad is mounted kind of deep inside the console Engine Integra LS GS comes with 1 8L 140HP 6400RPM and 125lb ft 4200RPM  Red zone is at around 6800RPM  non VTEC  It provides just enough power for daily drive  As I said  I should have bought a GSR or Type R which provides 170 and 195HP respectively with around  2K 3K more  One may ask why not get a muscle car like Mustang with cheaper price but higher HP  Personally  I admire the way Japanese and German built engines  Probably due to many racing events in those countries have placed limitations on engine size  Japanese and German automakers have traditions to build efficient and sophisticated engines  They can boost the engine to produce 100 HP on each liter  eg  S2000  Integra Type R  M3  and even the Enzo  Honestly  I don 146t know how much technology Ford has put in the Mustang engine in which only produce 190HP from 3 8L and 320HP from 4 6L Handling Since my car is automatic transmission  I can 146t say much about handling  However  some sharp corning has been quite stable and responsive on Integra  not sure if it is because I install the front strut bar  the same OEM one installed on GSR  Compare with RSX  test drive  apparently  Integra showed better stability on cornering  On RSX  in order to save space in front  the engine is mounted reversely and more towards the bumper  The result shifts the weight towards front of the front axles and this causes the more under steering  Road Holding is very good on Integra  thanks to 4 independent double wishbone suspensions Acceleration Acceleration is something really kills an AT Integra  I don 146t have a real figure on my Integra for 0 60mph  but most figures on the web showing around 10secs  a result of non VTEC and 4 gears  instead of 5 on MT  The engine is especially hard to pick up the speed in 2nd and 3rd gears Braking Integra equips with 4 disc brakes and ABS with 4 wheel speed sensors  Because the car is lighter than average sedan  the brake is quite responsive Suspension Integra equipped with 4 independent double wishbone suspension which offers excellent response and handling  I also installed front strut bar from Acura  the same one comes with GSR models  Driver can really feel the road  but provide reasonably comfort  which makes it fun to drive on local or highway  I would say the suspension is sporty but not harsh Roominess Well  as a coupe  we can 146t expect much on roominess  There is not much space in fact for passengers  The driver seat is most suitable for 5 14610 146 146 people with average size  For me  I have to push the driver seat all the way back so that my leg won 146t hit the steering wheel when pressing the brake pedal  even after I set the steering wheel to its highest position  thus the passenger seat behind is basically useless  The trunk is large enough to put 1 mid size and 1 large luggage  but can accommodate more when folder down on passenger seats Tires The original tires comes with my Integra are Michelin XGT V4  Ultra Performance  Most people don 146t have a good review on these tires though  So far it is ok with me  and I don 146t think I haven 146t pushed them to the limit yet Equipments As expected from most Honda vehicles  it provided most equipments as standard  which is good for me as a first time buyer  The Integra GS comes with standard leather trim  moonroof  CD player  6 speakers  immobilizer  alloy wheels  leather steering wheel  power windows  and power locks Headlights Though the 4 round front headlights provide distinctive look  it does not provide adequate brightness on near ground  The focus seems to be on distance objects but not on foreground near the car  Sometimes I don 146t see a bump till 15 20 feet away  That 146s why I installed fog light to compensate this  as well as for cool looking  I used PIAA extreme whites and PIAA super plasma for low beams and fog lights respectively  which are much better than average halogen bulbs Safety Only front driver and passenger airbags are provided which provide average protection  2000 and 2001 Integras have installed 2 strong steel side impact beams on each front door to protect passenger from fatal injury  4 disc brakes with ABS provide reasonably active safety Reliability After driving the car for 2 5 years  I don 146t see any major mechanical problem at all on my Integra  Here is the list of problem I encountered so far 1  Key got locked in steering column  It turns out to be my 3rd party security system has screwed up the circuit  NOT the problem from my car  Acura dealer was very helpful to diagnose the problem for me 2  Passenger seat is a bit out of the track  This got fixed with any charge  under warranty Acura provides 4 year warranty which is better than average Japanese made automobiles Insurance Prepare to live with high premium on Integra  From statistics  Integra appeals theft seven times more than average sedans  Partly due to its high resell value and popularity  and also because most of its mechanical components can be used on Civic without much modification   We all know that Civic has been a popular modification target for street rocket and that create a huge demand on Integra components In conclusion  I enjoy and love my Integra very much  My only complaint is the horsepower  As I said  I should have bought the GSR  170HP  or even Type R  195HP  If you are looking for a used fun car to drive with reliability  I would definitely recommend Integra  
Auto, I have driven Chevy  Dodge  GMC  and even Harvester trucks  By far I still find my Ford pickups the best there is  I bought a F250 Super Duty Extended Cab 4x4 pickup with the 7 3 diesel  I love this engine  With my heavily laden camper  my family  dog  and stuff it just cruised up and down hills and mountain passes without ever slowing down  Previously my favorite Ford engine had been the 300 6 cylinder  It was extremely reliable  but it just did not have much power at upper highway speeds when loaded  With the diesel engine I set the cruise control at about 65 mph and never slowed down while traveling through the passes on the interstate 5 from Oregon to California  The fuel economy is just about what you would expect from this class of engine  16 18 miles per gallon  I suppose my chief complaint about the truck would be how noisy the diesel engine is  I guarantee that if Ranger Walker had this engine he would not sneak up on anybody with it unless they were completely deaf  Of course  the F250 is just a bit bumpy without any load in the back it s a 4x4 super duty  I ve taken the trunk onto the sandy beaches at Long Beach and driven up and down the coast line with no problems  The four wheel drive just goes  When wandering up into the Cascades I just put it in four wheel drive and never have a problem in the snow  All in all  in spite of the engine noise and unloaded intestine rattling ride  I love this truck  If you need a truck this size or just think you do like me  this is the right one

content 44580114052 SmartMedia Memory Card a A USB cable CD with software and drivers Instruction manual  Software Guide and Registration     My Test Results  b b Movies  The movies are rather small but remember this camera is a still photo camera so the movies are an extra feature added  The 320 x 240 HQ mode is rather small on the computer but it produces a nice 15 second movie without any sound  The 160 x 120 SQ mode is too small for me but it produces a longer movie of about 60 seconds and seems clearer because of the smaller size  Movie shots need to be taken in well lighted areas b Photo Color  The photo color is great especially in outdoor shots and well lighted indoor shots b Sharpness  The photos seem to have pretty good clarity but when closely looking around the corners they seem to get a little distorted  Printing up the photo on a 4 x 6 inches print produced a flawless photo  printing the same photo on an 8 x 10 showed a slight distortion but it is hardly noticeable unless you look for it b Night Shots  The Night shots outside are pretty good as long as the subject isn 146t too far away and that there is some decent lighting around  The night shots do tend to produce a little more noticeable grain than the day time shots b Outdoor Shots  About the best of all the shots taken  bright and colorful  In some instances the sun may be too bright  then you need to compensate with the Exposure Compensation to get your best results  Using the flash outdoors in the Auto mode also helps in producing great photos that are up close b Flash Shots  The flash is alright  it just isn 146t made for any distance shots  Under most flash shots within about 10 feet the photos turned out rather well  Incandescent lighting is tough sometimes and I find the setting the camera on the incandescent whit balance setting helps  You may have to experiment with settings to get your best results b Batteries  I was using the Ni MH rechargeable batteries and did take 150 shots before recharging and it still had power to shoot a few more b Use  The Olympus D 380 is about as easy as it comes to using and setting up to use with your computer  You can make some minor adjustments to get the camera to your preference but then it is basically just point at the subject  hold the shutter button down half way for the camera to auto focus for you and then push the button all the way down to snap the photo  The software and driver loaded without any problems on my computer using Windows ME and uploading the photos to the computer are automatic once I connect the USB cable to the camera and computer b  Overall  b This is a camera that a lot of people will enjoy for the price  ease of use and photo quality This is a great camera for the first timer or the

Camera, I was never that interested in getting a digital camera  Yeah  I thought they looked nice and the concept was good  They were always too expensive though  For my birthday this year my girlfriend EpinionID Mookasaurs  bought me the Kodak Millenium Edition camera The Millenium package came with an 8 Mb picture card and a USB Removable disk  The 8 Mb card will hold about 26 pictures with this camera  Very similar to the 25 pictures I was accustomed too with my advantix  I wasn t quite content with that  When I go places I usually bring a couple rolls of film  For use around the house 8 Mb is plenty  I can take 26 pictures  load them on my hard drive and go for another round  If I m away though I can do that  I was able to acquire a 32 Mb picture card and now I have plenty of storage for my pictures  This card will hold 113 pictures at the highest resolution and over 250 at the lowest  I ve even heard that there is a 196 Mb picture card out  that s just amazing The removable disk is very convenient  It looks like a little mouse  It connects into a USB port in your computer and you can slide your picture disk into the slot  This is much more convenient than hooking the camera up to the computer every time you want to read the disk  The setup for this was really easy and I was so close to being able to do it without the directions  Of course my mom always says  people get paid good money to write those directions Enough about the gizmos and gadgets  I m sure you want to know about the camera  The camera is extremely easy to use  I still haven t had to crack open the instruction booklet yet  It only takes a few minutes to set the time  date and any other settings like resolution  Put the picture card in and you re ready to go  For those who are use to a regular camera you ll notice that the digital camera is much heavier  Part of this is because of the 4 AA batteries required to operate the camera  Flip the power on  set the camera to capture mode  aim and shoot  The picture will then come up on the LCD screen on the back of the camera  You have the option to delete it if you want  I suggest you don t delete pictures till you need the space  Even bad pictures are nice to look at later on in life  You can always download them to your computer and not have to worry about them taking space on your picture card  You can also set the camera to review mode and look at all of the pictures you have taken so far  You re allowed to delete pictures in this mode also The camera has three different flash modes  On  off and red eye reduction  The flash is extremely bright so don t look directly into the light  There is also a timer on the camera so you can set it down and get into the picture yourself  The zoom lens on the camera is a very nice feature to take close ups  There are a couple of downsides to the digital camera  With regular cameras you can take pictures one after the other  The digital camera has like a 10 second pause where it is writing the picture to the disk  This can cause you to miss some good pictures  It also chews up batteries at a good rate  I ve gone through a set of batteries already in just three weeks  The only other problem I can see is the inconvenience of having to get pictures developed  All of the options there are to get them developed seem really expensive Overall I suggest investing in one of these cameras  You can email all your pictures to friends and family  put them on your web site or just keep them on your computer for your personal viewing br br  
Auto, With a sport look to it that my mother loves  the 4X4 capability that my father bought it for her for  The great looks of driving it for the college age kids it is defiantly a family vehicle  This is the road 4X4 for the City Street  It handles like a car it can take on the snow in 4X4 with out a problem  The ABS breaks perform well in all kinds of weather  With a couple times in the shop for a defective transmission a year after purchase  The interior is comfortable  drives to work or the trip to grandma s house   The back seat sits 2 comfortably but 3 adults is not comfortable  The finish on the car scratches easily at the car wash   The built in display council on the ceiling is great  With the security system standard in most editions and the remote key less entry standard  The cargo capacity is great in the rear  With the ability to remove the back seat in either of the two sections  They come out easily and go back in just as easy  Good all around for all drivers br br  
Camera, I bought the HP C200 by accident  I was really just wanting to upgrade my printer to a better  Photo Quality quot  one  The rep from the factory was in the store and answered all my questions about the printer and then added that HP was having a special  the printer with the camera with a rebate  I already have 2 digital cameras so I wasn t too interested  He proceeded to take some pictures with the camera and print them off  Well as the old saying goes   quot a picture is worth a thousand words quot  I was sold  I have digital cameras that cost 3X as much and don t have near the quality off the C200  I would recommend it to anyone who is either a beginner or semi pro  It is easy to use and light to carry  I can place it in my purse for those unexpected opportunities for a fun shot  I am waiting for the new model to come out so I can try it also  It is also handy to just  pop  it into the printer and print out the photo without the computer br br  
Camera, I ve been doing photography for 25 years  mostly with 35mm SLRs  I own 2 Nikon F2 cameras and 8 Nikkor lenses  and have always been a  Nikon man  This company has products which  in my opinion  are far superior to all but the most expensive  German made  cameras  and in any event Nikon cameras are UNEQUALED in durability and flexibility  Next time you see a newspaper photographer  you will probably notice he she is using Nikon equipment  That s no accident  Nikons stand up to abuse better than anything else I bought the CP5000  first  for the 5 megapixel feature  As a long time user of Nikkor lenses  I am used to outstanding image quality  and I demand it in my photography  I have found that this camera delivers it  when I use it within its limitations  more on that later  Also  as I mentioned  the Nikon name means quality to me  and I haven t been disappointed with the 5000 The first thing I noticed when I anxiously opened the box for the first time is that this camera is TINY  Almost too small for my liking  as I am a big guy with big hands  but I got used to it  Moreover  as I am used to the heavy  all mechanical F2  it was disconcerting to take a picture and not hear and feel that shutter cycle and the mirror slam home  but this  too  I got used to  An F2 with motor drive and battery pack can weigh close to 5 pounds  depending on the lens used  This is definately no F2 The technology that went into this camera is nothing short of amazing  I cannot believe the things it can do  and the flexibility of modes of operation is impressive  In this respect  this camera is every bit a Nikon  A lot of the features are probably availiable on other digital cameras in the same price range  but I was used to a mechanical camera  so I was impressed The lens is excellent  although I am somewhat disappointed with the edge sharpness in extreme close ups  Please keep in mind  however  that I am used to using high end  professional quality lenses  The flexibility of the CP5000 lens is such that it cannot do everything equally well  The very fact that this is a 3X wide to tele zoom  that can focus to 3 4  is amazing  It is unfair to compare it with my 55mm f 3 5 Micro Nikkor  While center sharpness is outstanding  if you intend to do a lot of extreme close ups  don t expect it to perform like a dedicated close up lens Some things that I like  The incredible image quality  and I am a VERY demanding user in that respect  The 8X10 prints I produce with this camera get a lot of comments like  That s a digital camera  Wow  In spite of my initial reservations about the small size  I can put it in my pocket and take candids of my drunk friends at the bar  I can t do that with an F2  The abundant features  like multi mode auto exposure  white balance preset  you set the white balance by reading a white card  which makes it possible to have a perfect setting in ANY light conditions  Very cool  Also  manual focus override is useful for extreme close ups  This camera does more stuff than 95  of users will ever need  but whatever your requirements  you will find features that make you say  Wow  that s cool  This camera has a solid feel  The body is made of magnesium  and in spite of it s tiny size  it has a nice heft  You can tell it s not a plastic camera  The swiveling LCD screen is great for shooting at waist level  or other strange positions  Great for candid photography Some complaints  The flash sensor is placed in just about the worst spot imagineable for someone with big hands  It s easy to get used to if you use the camera regularly  but if I hand it to someone else I have to warn them to keep their fingers out of the way    The autofocus is slow  so if you pick up the camera and try to  grab  a quick shot  you sometimes miss it while the camera focuses  If you prefocus the camera by half pressing the shutter button  however  there is almost no shutter lag at all  This is a lot better than other digital cameras  This point deserves some discussion  I notice that many reviews say that this camera has no shutter lag at all  while others say thet the lag is unacceptable  This camera does not have shutter lag   it has autofocus lag  There is new firmware  that I have not installed yet  that is supposed to improve autofocus performance  I hope it helps That s about all  It is a fact that no matter what camera you buy  something better will be availiable in a few months that will be better  and the one you bought will be availiable for a couple of hundred dollars less  Overall  I m happy with the CP5000  The quality and features are worth the money  
Auto, This review is being written in appreciation of the time spent by others doing reviews that I have read  There is information readily available about what features are available on the Lexus LS430 so I won t spend time rehashing that  I recently purchased a 2002 LS430 with the ultra package  April 2002  My previous car was a 1999 Lexus GS400 that I traded for the LS430  Prior to that I traded a 1997 Acura RL3 5 for the GS400  and a 1993 BMW 750iL  which I traded for the Acura  I traded the BMW for the Acura because at 55k miles it started to cost serious money to maintain for stuff that never should have failed at that mileage  BMW s attitude was that a car is a machine and machines break  Thus the switch to something Japanese  after I told a dealer that sold both Acura and Mercedes that reliability was important to me he said forget the Germans I took a 550 mile trip with the Lexus LS430 the day after I bought it and my impressions are based on that  I got 24 5 mpg when I average 80 85 mph  I got 27 mpg when I kept it to 65  At 55  pretty hard to go that slow  I got 28  mpg  Pretty amazing for a 290 hp blaster  That is better than my GS400 The first thing that I noticed with the LS430 versus my GS400 was that the tightness and handling of the LS430 was not up there with the GS400  I now realized how precise the GS was  The LS is smooth though  There is no question that my trip was way more comfortable in the LS430 than it would have been with the GS400  The seats are very comfortable  The leather is soft and supple and I liked the fact that the bottom portion of the seat could be adjusted for leg length  giving a deeper seat  I am 6 1  so the extra length helped  I did a three hour and 45 minute stretch without a stop and I was not wiped out I live a couple of miles out a country road with a few nice curves  Having driven these curves so many times  and having challenged them with all three of my previous cars  I would say that the GS400 was best on them  The BMW 750iL next  then the LS430  followed by the Acura RL3 5  While the LS430 had noticeable body roll  I never lost confidence in my ability to hold the curve like I would in the Acura  Switching the air suspension from normal to sport mode made some difference  but not a night and day difference  The normal mode was satisfactory  The sport mode was better  Neither made it a BMW 750  or a Lexus GS400 The LS430 accelerates with authority  especially when going from 65 to 85 mph for a passing maneuver  The imprecise handling and lack of acceleration above 60 mph was why I abandoned the Acura  which in all other respects was an outstanding car whose fit  finish  and reliability was equal to Lexus  On my trip I cruised some stretches at 95 mph  and it was a breeze  The car was silky smooth and noiseless  It tracked beautifully  It was hard to believe that I was going so fast  If you punched the gas at 95 it downshifted and pulled with authority  Wonderful  Even the flagship BMW was not as good  in my humble opinion  although it was faster  I read a lot of comparisons on the internet about the Infinity Q45  the Lexus LS430  and the Mercedes S500 and S430 regarding power  All I can say is that all three have plenty  The Mercedes S430 doesn t cut the muster though  It is noticeably slower than those others  and that is why I don t mention it anymore  I won t spend any time with this Lexus LS430 wishing it had more snap  That is all that I ask I experimented with manual downshifting prior to passing on the interstate  While the Lexus LS430 does not have a sequential  tiptronic  type transmission  it snicked easily from D  drive  to 4th gear without having to let up on the accelerator  The downshift was executed smoothly and quickly  quicker that a press the gas to the floor forced downshift  The automatic kick down seemed to delay a little more than I liked I weaved in and out of traffic at high speeds effortlessly  It was sweet  Brakes were solid and easily controlled Now about some of the goodies  The navigation system is the best I have ever seen  My wife s Arura 3 2CL has a great nav system  but this one is even better  The whole U S  and Most of Canada comes included  My small  50 000  town in Oregon is in it but is not in hers  The touch controls are easy to master for common operations  The directions it gives are right on the money and it is has great flexibility in its set up  It responds to voice commands by pushing and releasing a button on the steering column  These commands can control the nav system and the audio controls through about 150 voice commands  You can access navigation functions with one voice command that take a up to four button pushes to get to on the touch screen  A voice confirms each one  You can switch audio or map functions with a word or phrase  It does a very good job of recognizing what you are saying  and you don t have to turn the radio down to talk  With you hit the voice button it mutes the audio system before you speak  I thought that this would be a basically useless gimmick when I read about it  but having tried it out  I like it  It is definitely useful  As I have said  many of the navigation screen and touch features are configurable for convenience and preference One cool surprise that I got was that when I entered the street address of the destination that I was headed to in Washington  it immediately knew what city and state it was in  I never entered the city and state  just the street address  The system navigated me there without a hitch  which was appreciated since there were numerous turns that had to be made once I exited the freeway  It got me there right on the money My brother wanted to take me to dinner at a restaurant that he had never visited  Sitting in his driveway I just selected  menu  points of interest  restaurant  Japanese  and bingo  it listed three in the area  one of which was the one we wanted  I selected that one and it led me there and back  Cool I played with the radar based adaptive cruise control  It worked as advertised  I turned on the cruise control and hit set  A small digital display showed me the speed that I had selected  A little picture of one car following another popped up and I was locked on  If that car slowed a little  so did I  maintaining the pre set distance  If it sped up beyond my pre set speed I speeded up until I hit my preset speed then leveled off  If another car cut between me and the car I was locked in on  my speed slowed until I was separated from the cut in car by the pre set distance  If my locked on car pulled away into another lane I sped up until I hit the pre set speed or came up on another car at the right distance  You can select from three following distances with a button on the steering wheel  A graphic indicates your selection and whether you are locked on to anything On the way up to Washington it started to rain  As soon as the first few drops fell the wipers took a swipe  These wipers are way cool  We passed a semi that splashed a bunch of water on my windshield  The wipers gave a frantic four wipes to clear the water then went back to occassional swipes  The nice thing about the wipers on the automatic setting is that you do not have to keep fiddling with the intermittent timing as the rain fall varies  It knows when to wipe again  Wonderful I used the radar based parking assist and I can see that in some circumstances it is helpful  This system tells you if you are getting within a couple of feet of an object in the front or rear when you are moving less than 6 mph  like when you are parking  I like the fact that a nice big display flashes up on the navigation screen indicating what is going on There are lots of little touches about the LS  Lights under the exterior mirrors illuminate where you step when approaching the car at night when you hit the unlock  The ignition illuminates and so does the seatbelt receptacle so you can find it in the dark  The temperature controls do an excellent job of keeping you comfortable without constant tweaking  You can set a  normal  volume level for the audio  and if you  or someone else  turn the volume up or down for some reason  one tap of a steering wheel mounted button returns you to your preferred setting  The driver can undo stuff done by backseat passengers like leaving headrests up or seats reclined  The three places to plug in a cell phone allowed me to have a radar detector plugged in and still charge both my wife s and my cell phone simultaneously  Self closing doors all around  Some people think self closing doors are total fluff but some elderly people or children have a problem closing car doors  A trip computer shows miles since last refueling  mpg on this tank  average mpg  instantaneous mpg  elapsed time  and more  You can view trip meter and odometer at the same time on yet another display  couldn t do that on my GS400   the Japanese are finally catching on  You can record a brief  2 5 min  digital message to yourself with the touch of an overhead button  This is good for leaving yourself a message or noting a phone number while you drive  The interior door handles illuminate at night when you turn the engine off so that you can find them in the dark What are some of the misses The navigation system cannot receive a new destination while you are moving  That means that even a passenger cannot make adjustments without you stopping the car  I tended to unintentionally bump certain buttons on the steering wheel causing stuff like changing the song selection on the CD or changing from CD to AM radio  The reading lights in the front are not as bright as they were in the GS400  I really liked those bright lights  The low beam headlight setting doesn t seem to aim far enough down the road  This may be dealer adjustable  Pretty petty stuff huh Other cars that I researched and considered before buying the LS430 were the Infinity Q45  the Mercedes S430 and S500  and the BMW 745  Of those I only test drove the Benzes  I sat in a BMW 745 and went over it with a salesperson  These are all great cars  Browsing lots of internet forums left me of the opinion that the German car dealerships were arrogant and not very customer oriented  I know from personal experience that BMW is not even worth talking to if you have an out of warranty problem  The Mercedes prices border on just plain silly  You are talking  15 20k more for the same amount of car  Don t buy that pap about superior engineering  They have good performance but the reliability lags Lexus  The BMW 745 is almost like a concept car  It is full of gee whiz technology that at times seems needlessly complex  There is no way 745iL buyers won t make multiple trips for warranty repairs  and heaven help them when the warranty ends  I was surprised at how many BMW 740iL  not 745iL  although there were a few of those  owners that I came across that traded them for a Lexus LS430  Reliability and dealer service were the two biggest reasons  They all said that they gave up some drivability when they switched to the Lexus LS430  but it was worth it to them  BMW prices are high too  So is Audi  It is a German thing  Once again I point out that even the worst of these cars is a very good car  These are the cream of the crop At this point I am very happy with my choice  Getting a break on price is not easy  9 1 01 jitters have made the supply low and Lexus is selling all they can make  I paid  69k out of the door  No car ever made is worth that much  but hey  you ve got to do what you ve got to do  
Auto, My wife and I were looking for a reliable new car and since I had a 1990 VW Golf with no problems  we decided to look for a new VW We decided to go with the new Jetta  99  and took one for a test drive  Several days later we drove away with our new black with tan interior GL  We bought the car in late June and it ran nice until the winter  The brakes on the car began to grind and groan  At times I could tell that there was more to the normal wear and tear of breaking in a new car  I went back to the dealer and they handed me a sheet of paper with directions for new brakes and what causes the sounds  OK  I thought this will do  but what about the other noises  The service department looked at the car and told me that there were some underbody screws loose and that they tightened them  Did not do the trick My wife and I went on a 4000 mile trip across the US and we took the Jetta  When we where in the middle of the country   we live in New England we developed a leak from the drivers side door  The leak sent water streaming down the door and into the top speaker  We had to place a towel there for the trip  Now this happened at high speeds like 70 75 on the trip  When we got back  the leak continued even at slow speeds One option we should have got was the VW helmet  When the car is placed into reverse there is a very uncomfortable jerk and your head goes flying back into the headrest  Also when you are taking off the car jerks into gear and causes everyone in the car to respond  quot whoa quot  I think that the car is OK overall  I don t know if are experience is uncommon or normal  but I have spoken to some people who have owned a new Jetta and they have had all the same trouble  Some have told me that the onboard computer causes these problems  I am unsure if I will buy another VW after this  and the shotty service I received from a full time VW dealer This is my Epinion damn it br br  
Auto, When BMW was first founded  the M  in BMW  has always stood for  Motoren  German for engine  Today  BMW makes a line of  M  cars that began with the famed M1 supercar of 1978  In 1988  the M Group introduced the M5  a high performance version of the 5 series  midsize luxury car  It was powered by a 256 horsepower  6 cylinder engine  Today  the M5 is a V8 powered luxury car with enough power to embarass a Corvette b EXTERIOR   The M5 is very stylish  yet VERY understated  The 18 inch alloy wheels and M badges are the only styling features that set it apart from lesser 5 series models  New for 2002  are chrome rings around the headlights  Another way to tell if an M5 IS an M5 is its 4 exhaust pipes b INTERIOR   No 5 series is as quiet as a Lexus in my opinion  but wind noise is kept at a bare minimum  The engine is very quiet at low rpms  At high rpms  the V8 engine can sound a bit whiny  Tire roar is noticeable from the high performance tires  but not loud enough to annoy me  The instruments are easy on the eyes and the gauges glow bright red at night  The tachometer even has a variable redline  When the engine is started cold  the redline is set at a lower rpm than usual  When the engine is warmed  the redline will reset itself to the full 7 000 rpm The navigation system is a VERY useful piece of equipment  assuming you know how to use it  Although not nearly as complex as Mercedes  COMMAND navigation system  BMW incorporates audio and climate controls into the navigation system which  to me  overcomplicates what is usually a simple task Up front  there is a LOT of room even for tall drivers  Usually  a sunroofs cut in on headroom  but this is NOT the case for the M5  or any 5 series for that matter  The front buckets are very supportive laterally  and EXTREMELY comfortable  The 16 way power seats also have a power lumbar adjustment  Even in the back  there is enough leg room for me  The seats in the back are just as comfortable as in the rear  Leather upholstery is standard  Wood interior accents add a very luxurious tone to the cabin  As far as cargo room is concerned  the narrow trunk can hold 11 1 cubic feet  subpar for the class b ENGINE   The M5 is powered by a 4 9 liter V8 engine  It produces 394 horsepower at 6 600 rpm  and 368 lb ft  of torque at 3 800 rpm  Around town  torque is always there  The M5 is so strong in fact  I have to keep an eye on the speedometer almost ALL the time  As expected with almost 400 horses  highway response is simply amazing  Most popular car magazines claim a 0 60 mph time of less than 5 seconds  So what is the punishment for that power  Horrible fuel economy  EPA estimate of 13 city and 21 highway indicate many pit stops per week  Premium fuel is required  The only transmisson option is a 6 speed manual transmission  The clutch is perfect  not too light  yet none too stiff  The shifter feel is great b HANDLING   Despite the fact that the M5 weighs 4 024 pounds  on twisty roads  you seldom feel it  The steering is weighted just right for me  There is very little body lean in the corners  Traction control is a must in snowy climates  considering that there is almost 400 horsepower at your disposal  Overall  the M5 is very fun to drive b RIDE   Although the M5 is very stiffly sprung  it actually rides quite good  Only moon like road surfaces upset the M5 s amazing balance  At high speeds  the 4 000 pound bullet is extremly stable  perfect for the Autobahn b RELIABILTY   All products from BMW are safe and reliable  but some 2000 and 2001 M5 s have been issued recalls  For more information  check out http www nhtsa gov cars problems recalls index cfm b VALUE   The M5 is a well built  fun to drive sports car  with executive like luxury and amenities  Although its  70 000 price tag suggests exlusivity  M5 is just too understated for my tastes  Personally  I would prefer more styling enhancements than that of lesser 5 series cars  All in all  if you are in the market for a high performance 4 door sports car with a lot of luxury items  the M5 is the perfect car for you  
Auto, I never paid much attention to the Mitsubishi Eclipse until the new body style came out  When I first saw others driving it  my imagination went to work  It reminded me of a small space ship ripping up and down the highway  I had to have one  however  I put it out of my mind because I was certain that I could not afford it  Though I purchased two other cars before I finally settled on the eclipse  I never stopped picturing myself driving it  Finally dissatisfied with my last vehicle  I decided to find out if I could afford the Mitsubishi Eclipse  My faith that there were good affordable cars out there was shaken  I test drove an RS model and it was solid and the ride was smooth  yet it still felt like a sports car  I went into the dealership and haggled over the final price and payments  when I finally decided to lease it for 3 years  Well this is my last year in the lease and I m still very satisfied with the car  I have not had any major problems with it at all  The only thing that was irritating was the third break light  There s nothing really supporting it  except for a piece of metal  After having it for two years  it started to bend and it finally broke off  I have discussed this with other Eclipse owners and they ve spoken of the same problem  That was really not big deal  because there was also a break light on my spoiler It was also irritating to me to have to get tune ups every 15 000 miles or so  I would recommend this vehicle to someone who wants the sports car feel and look  but not the sports car price  However  I would not recommend the RS model to a die hard sports car fan  You will be disappointed     
Camera, Let me start by saying I work for a College  and it with the vast resources of that College I was able to get my hands on this lovely little camera  I have used it extensively for a few months and have a couple of things to say for and against it  We ll start with the bad news  after a short time of being used the menu button  4 position joystick item  stopped functioning correctly  one must try several times when pushing it to the right  That s annoying  but forgivable  The biggest gripe I ve got with this unit is the excessive lag time when you push the button to take the picture  Our college also has a lesser Sony camera and it does not exhibit this problem  It does indeed make taking action photography impossible  in fact if the subject is moving at all you can bet the picture you get is not the picture you saw when you pushed the button  The next problem I luckily didn t have to deal with  the price of the camera  weighing it at around  1000 on a good day  it s too pricey for most consumers  The disk access time is reasonable  and any drawbacks of having to wait a few extra seconds is more than outweighed by the convenience of using dirt cheap and widely compatible 3 5  disks for media  Now let s get started on the good things about this camera  All frills and faults aside  the whole point of a camera is to take good pictures  well with minor adjustment of a few settings this camera takes fantastic pictures at up to 1600x1200dpi resolution  As per the fault of jpgs in general  the pictures do have noticeable artifacts when you zoom in  but at not enough to distract from the overall look of the photo  The program key on the side lets you adjust for different light settings  and has some very helpful presets in it  If you re feeling brave you can adjust the f stop or shutter speed manually via the first two options under the program key  Setting the f stop at around 8 and using the flash can produce rich colors and an improved depth of field over the standard method of shooting  One thing to be aware of is that when you do move the f stop to a higher number  it lets less light into the camera  thereby dimming the LCD panel  or viewfinder  considerably  because the camera does not have an optical viewfinder this makes it difficult to frame pictures well with the f stop set to a high number  I rarely find myself using the top mounted viewfinder on the camera as the LCD panel provides a larger and more visible depiction of what the camera is pointed at  A very neat little gadget they thought to build into this camera is a sensor in the viewfinder  The viewfinder is off until you move it close to your eye to look through it  at which point it comes one  very neat  still I wish they would have went for an optical viewfinder  Macro and auto focus both work very well for most applications  manually focussing the camera is a little difficult because of the sensitivity of the focus ring on the end of the lens  The Steady Shot  as it s namesake  keeps the camera from responding to every tiny movement in your hand  creating a steadier picture with less chance of motion blur  The flash on the camera works well for all non macro photos  As I had mentioned before to get a good picture with the flash you would have to set the f stop  anywhere from 4 9 6  which causes your preview image to go dark  For macro shots  the lens gets in the way of the flash  causing a u shaped ring of darkness on the photo  alternative lighting is necessary for such photos  The lens has a 52mm filter thread on the end for attaching any of your favorite optical filters to the camera  The built in filters take care of a lot of problem color issues  and the built in effects can produce some very interesting photos  I m thoroughly in love with the sepia effect on this camera  The camera can take up to 15 second mpeg movies  with real time audio and video  I found that impressive  You can even set the camera to allow you to record an audio track with every picture you take  those features and related ones I haven t had much use for  but it is nice to have them  
Camera, Excellent choice for a digital camera  I purchased the Olympus D 620L because of the  1  zoom capability and  2  through the lense viewing  Have owned the D 620L for about six months  now  using it for news coverage for a weekly newspaper  in all conditions from low light to using alternative flash sources and have found it to be an excellent overall use camera At the time of purchase  the camera was at the high end of non professional cameras at about  900  but understand that the price range has dropped Using the  quot super fine quot  mode  1700 pixels  the 16 mb Smartcard will hold between 16 and 18 photographs  so if the user needs to photograph more photos in one setting  one must purchase additional Smartcards at a price of about  75 each  Download directly from the camera to the computer is slow  about 1 minute per photo  However  by using a Flashpath adapter in the 3 1 2 quot  computer drive  download time is cut by about one half   SmartCard adaptors cost range from about  75 to  100  but well worth it Autofocus feature is excellent  though cannot focus in low light conditions or in conditions with little or no contrast viewfinder provides a view of about 95  of picture area  Under moderate low light conditions  the camera will expose the photo  but causes blurring when the subject is moving My first digital was a Ricoh digital with two zoom settings  portrait and distant  but had only 750 pixel maximum capabilities  I chose the Olympus D 620L as a replacement because of the larger format area and through the lens system  one of the very few  quot personal quot  cameras capable of this feature The small built in flash is excellent for short distance photography but is not adequate for a distance beyond about 20 feet  Beyond that range  one must use a separate after market flash  but is difficult to get the flash s settings so that one does not either under or over expose  After downloading photographs  however  when using a quality software  I use Adobe Photoshop  one can readily enhance  crop  modify colors  contrast and sharpness  The camera comes with a software program that has limited capabilities in this area  but is useful if no other photo software program is available The D620L is surprisingly lightweight  Camera controls are easy to use  easy to learn and to remember  The small review screen located on the back of the camera provides an excellent review of either the latest picture taken  or preview pictures  However  when using the viewfinder  one is very likely to get facial oils on the small review screen  requiring regular cleaning  I installed a clear plastic cover over the screen to eliminate this factor and to protect the sensitive  easily scratchable screen from damage  the protective screen works well and is removable  using velcro The camera eats up regular alkaline batteries  four  particularly in high mode photography and with flash  I use rechargeable batteries  two sets that are interchangeable to help correct this problem  The camera s setting screen  that gives the photographer information about the various settings of the camera  does provide an accurate display of battery condition so that one can interchange batteries when battery condition become low  the camera will not function when battery condition falls below that required Overall  however  I have found the Olympus D620L an excellent choice for digital cameras in the medium price range  below  1 000     
Auto, I am the proud owner of my second Chevrolet Tahoe  I purchased my first one in 1995  the first year they were made as the full sized SUV  It had previously been known as the K 5 Blazer  With 4 doors and a folding rear seat  it had plenty of room for all my antique auction treasures as well as plenty of room when I traveled  I was single at the time and had part ownership of an antique shop  My first Tahoe gave me over 100 000 miles of trouble free service  The air conditioner ran full time in the summers and my only repair was a  25 switch  I traded in my 1995 model on a 1998 model and it too  has so far  been trouble free  There is plenty of room for 5 adults and plenty of gear  I am married with a 2 year old son now and when we travel to auctions or to visit my family  it s great to have all the room and luxury the Tahoe offers  I love everything about my Tahoe and hate nothing  Any family would be proud to have this fine vehicle  even if they cost as much as a small house used to cost  That s the only thing I don t like about the Tahoe   the extremely high price     
Camera, I wondered why professional online reviewers such as steves digicams and dpreview made no mention of this camera  I think I can tell you why  This is a 5 megapixel camera designed for low end consumers  However  I will tell you that there are things to like As I understand it  the DX4 series is supposed to be higher end consumer  DX4530 means  DX4 higher end  5 megapixels  3 zoom ratio  0 don t know  Why make a 5 mpixel camera that has the control you d expect from a 2 mpixel camera Pro  the camera is lightweight  230g or 250g with batteries  it uses AA batteries  hooray  it is small  comfortable to hold  easy to use  Most unusual is that it has lens threads for addons  MSRP is  400 Cons  Menus are totally dumbed down  which means few options  You d expect more from a 5 megapixel camera  Compression  jpeg quality setting  is too high and not settable  A 3 star image is 5 megapixel image with a jpeg quality setting that results in files that are typically 800 KB in size  From most 5 megapixel cameras you would expect file sizes of 2 MB at high quality  No lighting adjustment setting  incandescent  fluorescent  etc  No gimmicks such as panorama assist and color filters  sepia  etc I compared indoor flash and non flash photos to a Sony DSC V1  OK  this isn t terribly fair  but I wanted to understand how Kodak falls short  The image resolution hardly suffered from the high compression  low quality  JPEG setting  but the colors were noticeably off  too saturated  If you understand JPEG algortihms  this is what you expect   the compression mostly squeezes out chrominance information  so the colors get messed with  but image resolution is largely preserved  I tried to get information from Kodak about the JPEG settings that were chosen  Thru support I received an uninformative letter that told me all Kodak cameras squeeze 5 1  Note  this is nonsense  jpeg doesn t allow you to choose compression ratio because it depends on the image contents  Also a 5 megapixel image is 15 Megabytes of data  so the compression ratio is closer to 15 1  Similarly a senior employee in marketing was unable to provide any information beyond sales blather Conclusion The pictures were only OK  but since the camera is dumbed down  we ll never know if the hardware might be capable of far better quality  The camera needs to offer far more user settings If you want a 5 mpixel camera that uses AA batteries  highly desirable  you have other choices  See steves digicams com for a summary table If you want a threaded lens adapter  you have very few choices and most others   except for Sony DSC V1   are heavy and bulky  
Auto, I purchased a 2003 Infinity G35 sports sedan about 10 weeks ago  It s silver  with a black leather interior  moonroof  sports suspension package and Bose stereo  I wrote my first review  just days after taking delivery  and in retrospect  I feel I didn t do the car the justice it deserves  After spending more time behind the wheel  I now believe I can give a fair  accurate report  Much of my initial impressions are still valid  The car has incredible power  awesome handling and spectacular brakes  The seats are really comfortable and the car looks just great  But one of the nicest things about the car is the sound  The engine has the warmest purr at low speeds  not too loud  not too soft  and a tremendous roar when you nail it  I really enjoy just putting down the windows  opening the moonroof and just cruising  However  in my initial review  I felt the sports package made the ride too firm  But in hindsight  I believe it s just right  My former car had a much softer suspension and I when I first began driving the G35  I wasn t used to the ride  After several weeks  the car s ride now feels fine  It is firm  but nicely so  and not too jarring  I was also not too kind to the Bose stereo  But with some adjusting  I was able to get a really clear  crisp sound  You just have to crank it up  I still have some small gripes though  The ergonomics of the stereo and climate control systems are just plain confusing and difficult to adjust while you re driving  And one aspect of the car s operation is  in my opinion  somewhat dangerous  When you start the car  the dash lights up automatically  During the day  no problem  But at night  it gives you the impression that your headlights are on when they aren t   with every car I ve ever driven  the dash lights come on when you turn on your headlights  The first time this happened to me I was pulling out of a parking lot at night and just about got nailed  It s really something Infinity should look into  All in all though  the G35 is a great car  Great looks  great performance and a great price  There s nothing wrong with that  
Camera, My office just purchased one of these cameras last week and we still haven t gotten finished oohing and ahhing over it  It is so chock full of features that we have yet to use them all  and we play I mean work with this thing daily Like most Sony Digital cameras  it features an LCD screen on the back of the camera  This is used to preview the pictures you shoot  It also has a viewfinder that is only one when you put your eye up to it  so it actually detects that you are looking through it  How cool is that  Also standard to Sony digitals is the built in diskette drive for storing the photos and video  In addition to standard floppies  you can buy an adapter that fits into the floppy drive and allows you to use memory sticks for storing even more pictures and video The average 640x480 picture taken by this camera is about 37k and looks great  The 1600x1280 pics are roughly 350k and look perfect  This is an excellent camera for taking and printing pictures on photo quality paper and framing  It s 2 1 megapixels  and you need at least 2 0 megapixels to properly print 8 5x11 size paper pictures  This gives you just a little extra for your money It s a little heavy  and not really a small camera  so you wouldn t want to lug this thing around a theme park all day  Then again  maybe you would just because you d get the respect of other techies and photographers in the park The Sony DigiMavica FD 95 is very easy to use and takes excellent quality pictures  I recommend you buy the diskette adapter and memory sticks in order to store more and larger pictures br br  
Camera, I received this camera as a birthday present back in February  I have used it constantly since  I have three kids  ages 4  2 and 10 months  So everyone is always wanting pictures  I chose this camera mainly because of the 4 2 MP  and the size of it  I also liked it because it is an HP and so is our computer and printer  The picture quality is wonderful  even when the kids are moving   Which mine constantly are  The color is great  even in low light  The only thing I wasn t 100  happy about is the small disk it came with  When we went to the fair I used up my 13 pictures within the first hour   it can vary from 11 to 14 pictures on the disk  depending on the memory each picture takes  So I ended up having to borrow someone else s camera to take the rest of the pictures because I wasn t willing to delete any  Now I am a picture aholic  so some people may not have this problem  but I went and got another disk with a larger capacity  Some people complain about the batteries in this camera  I have had it for almost six months and changed the batteries twice  I average about 5 7 pictures a day  including the self timer and video feature which use more battery life  So I d say the batteries last quite awhile  I use the Lithium batteries  and defiently recomend them  They aren t that much more expensive in my opinion  I didn t get the docking port  because since we have an HP computer all I have to do is plug it in and it automatically uploads the pictures that I took  I also saw some complaints about delay  the only time I have had that problem is when I accidently had it on the timer feature  Otherwise the pics snapped almost instantly  My son dropped this camera on the floor  which is industrial tile  from his level  about counter top height  and the only problem we had was a slight scuff spot on it  All features still work with no damage  This is the best digital camera I have used so far  
Camera, I ve been dying for a digital camera for years  and an online friend picked up a little  50 Vivitar at Wal Mart that took AWESOME pics  I researched it online  and while doing so the Vivitar 3615 caught my eye  my husband and I decided that we should  splurge  and get the more expensive model  We haven t regretted it since  It takes very clear pics in either high or low resolution mode  although I can t really tell the difference  in low res mode you will be able to take more pics before uploading them  The manual says it can hold around 86 pics  but when we took pics of the fireworks on July 4  I had over 130 in the camera  And that s without any additional storage card  Pictures upload quickly  and you have the option of selecting changing your file for uploading to  you can also have the computer delete the pics from the camera once they re uploaded  The LCD viewscreen is very clear  the only problem I have with it is that it gets in the way of my nose when I m trying to use the viewfinder  so I end up either cleaning the screen after each picture or holding my head at an awkward angle while I m taking pictures The batteries don t seem to last too long  but being rechargeables I expected that  I invested in an additional set of batteries and a rapid charger  total cost   30  so I always have a fully charged set on hand  plus a pack of alkalines in case of emergency  Once in a while  if the camera is jarred too hard the batteries will shift and cause the camera s time date settings to reset  I also get the occasional blurry pic  but that s user error  not camera defect The flash works very well  almost TOO well in many conditions  I was playing with my 6 YO daughter  and took a picture of her in a completely dark room  the flash made it appear that she was in a well lit room  Often I get pics where my subject  usually my cats  are washed out because it s too bright  but I get enough good quality pics that I can overlook the few bad ones Overall  I would highly recommend this camera  whether you re a first time digital buyer or on a budget  I do plan on getting a different one in the future  hopefully with video camera mode  but I assure you  I will not get rid of this one  I have already saved hundreds of dollars on film  this camera pays for itself in a short period of time  It s wonderful  
Camera, The latest addition to Olympuses digital camera lineup is the C 3030  The C 3030 is a 3 3 megapixel camera which will produce very nice looking 8x10 s  Although the C 3030 Zoom s black body looks like its predecessor s  the grip side of it is made of a lighter plastic that s lightly larger and textured  At under 11 ounces without batteries  the camera falls into the compact category  The C 3030 s perfect placement of function buttons  including the multi directional navigation buttons seen on most digicams  belies the complexity of the camera s all encompassing functionality  The zoom lever  operated with the index finger rather than the thumb  does take a little getting used to and the untethered lens cap  a stupid design flaw  makes it easy to lose  But overall  the camera s body is designed very well  The Olympus 3x optical zoom aspherical glass lens and CCD have always been among the industry s best  The 1 2 inch CCD chip is larger in this model therefore offers a slightly larger field of view  This hardware is capable of capturing images at resolutions of 2048 by 1536  1600 by 1200  1280 by 960  1024 by 768  and 640 by 480 in both JPEG and uncompressed TIFF formats  This flexibility may be confusing  there s also a Normal and Quality setting for each JPEG  but we like these options because they give many more options to the photographer  Plus  Olympus includes a 16MB SmartMedia card  absolutely the minimum size for a camera in this class  You can take about six shots at the highest quality level  SHQ  123 Web ready shots  640 by 480  or one 2048 by 1536 uncompressed TIF shot on this card I have been selling Olympus digital cameras for years and really support there products  I would recommend this camera to just about anyone in the market for a high end consumer camera br br  
Auto, i bought this vehicle after reading many positive reviews in consumer reports and other auto magazines and due to the great reputation for Mitsubishi vehicles and also  because it is simply the best rated convertible on the market I believe everyone should own drive a convertible before they die  because it is an unforgettable and uplifting experience  young  old should own this car the things i love about this vehicle are the ease of the automatic convertible top  i have previously owned 2 other convertibles and this top is too easy to maneuver  it is a very sexy looking convertible and you will get many looks   driving this car in the summer  It is also very maneuverable convertible and hugs the road well  If you choose the mitsubishi sound system  you wont regret it   because it is top notch  the things i hate about this vehicle are the poor gas milage and the way the rain gets you wet inside the vehicle due to poor window placement size  be prepared to take another car  if it looks like rain you will get wet if your window is open   even a crack  and i mean wet your pants are hit the hardest also  i dislike the poor visability in this vehicle due to small angled windows in front and rear very poor rear visability  but these are downfalls of most convertibles today  this car is very easy to drive due to the front wheel drive suspension   i was almost killed in a rear wheel drive convertible  and its maneuverablility is superb  This car is great for old and young alike  but not recommended for transporting children for safety reasons and small rear area  I strongly recommend this vehicle as a great and reliable convertible for the price br br  
Auto, I bought the Chevrolet Cavalier because I wanted a small  reliable  and affordable car  It has met my expectations in all cases  I really like the design  because it has a sporty look  and I like the fact that it is more reliable on the road than some of the other small cars I ve owned  While it s perfect for me at 5 7 quot  tall  I ve known some of my 6  friends to complain about it being too small for their comfort  The car handles well  including a sense of safety in winter driving  By keeping up with scheduled maintenance  I ve had almost no problems  The only repair I ve had to do is to have the resistor on the heater fan replaced  If you re looking for a small  affordable  reliable car  I would recommend it  If you re looking for lots of leg room  check for a bigger model br br  
Camera, I got the PDR M5 as a Christmas gift from my husband  I had wanted a digital camera for my birthday in October  but we just couldn t decide on which one to get when we were shopping for one  He went out shopping by himself after that and talked to many people  finally deciding on this camera  I think if you are in the market for a digital camera  it is definitely worth your money to get as many pixels as possible  The lower end cameras are just not worth it  This camera has many great features  I love the pop up flash  the zoom  wide angle  macro  etc  It takes pictures that are very sharp  The first pictures that I emailed to a group of friends came back with many comments about how clear the picture was  and comments such as WOW I wish my camera took pictures like that I also like the fact that you can take shots in different resolutions  depending on how high a quality you need the picture to be  and also how many pictures you need to fit on your media card  The camera tells you how many pictures you can still fit on the card  at each of the resolutions It s very easy to get the pictures to your computer  Just install the software that comes with the camera  and hook up by USB or Serial Port to download them Another GREAT feature is that it comes with a video out jack and cord that you can plug right into your tv to see the pictures  We have a 61 quot  big screen tv  and when putting the pictures on the tv  we expected to loose some of the sharpness  blowing them up so big  but they were amazingly clear  sharp  and clean  One way I think we ll use this feature is to keep all of our vacation pictures on a separate media card  and look at them as a slide show on the tv  This camera will also take video clips  but does not record sound as other cameras do  You can add sound later if you download them using the software  and recording an audio clip through your computer to go with the picture Even though we ve had this camera only a short time  I know already it was a good choice  When using it at the family Christmas gatherings  I could tell everyone was pretty impressed with it Another great use for a digital camera is if you sell items on ebay or other auction sites  Taking a picture with a digital camera  downloading it into your computer  and then deleting it off the media card  saves LOTS of money compared to buying film  developing film  having to scan the photos  and then throwing them away after the item sells  That is a waste of money I plan to do a lot more selling on ebay now that I have a digital camera br br  
Auto, Three weeks ago  I bought a 2000 Acura 3 2TL  Though the 92 octane gas gets to be a little expensive  the mileage on this car is so great  that I hardly notice  I got the one with the GPS built in  and I never get lost  I crack up whenever I hear it say  quot quick turn ahead quot  because the programming on the voice is such that it does not manage to say it perfectly The car handles wonderfully  The acceleration is so smooth that I got to 80  and without looking at my speedometer  thought I was going too slow on the highway  The suspension is good enough that when the road surface gets rough  you can barely feel it  The anti lock brakes are so good you can stop on a dime  The car is aerodynamic  and there is very little wind noise when you drive  The sportshift  a  quot Manual Override quot  for the automatic transmission  is wonderfully smooth  and almost gives you the same feel that you have with manual transmission  However  you almost never use it because the normal automatic transmission is so smooth that it is hard to feel the difference In short  this is a wonderful car  for anyone willing to spend the  30 000 dollars to buy it  and the only problem with it  is that you love it so much  if it gets dinged  you break into a crying fit  about the poor car  that with the purr of the engine  seems to be as alive as your family cat br br  
Camera, All I can say after using this camera for a few days is WOW  I love it  It s so easy to use  It takes great pictures and it is a lot of fun  The battery lasts for a reasonably long time and you can take over 100 pictures on one battery  Before buying any other digital camera  make sure you go and at least check this one out  The features on the camera are second to none br br  
Camera, I have owned the 2600 for a little over a year now and overall it has been a pretty decent camera  My usual disclaimer  manufacturers spend lots of money on their own websites where you can pick up the technical specs of cameras  I just want to give you my opinion on the camera not be redundant with information you can easily pick up elsewhere Overall the image quality will look good to the majority of people  I have printed out up to 8x10 size using Photo Glossy paper on an Epson Photo EX that looks very good  not as good as a 35mm 8x10  but still very good for a 2meg Digital  Unless you are real camera buff or picky picky picky you should be pleased with the image quality you will receive  Maybe it is just me  but the printed quality looks better than the digital image I see on my computer screens 133strange  A Kodak DC 260 that I used to shoot with seemed to have better screen image quality when viewed on a monitor than the 2600 The view screen on the back has adjustable brightness  but as with many such screens it is difficult to see in very bright sun conditions  It can also be difficult to tell if a picture is blurred unless you use the zoom feature to look closer at the picture  I personally find myself using the viewfinder more than the screen when taking the actual shots Ergonomically the 2600 is not bad  It is small  fairly lightweight and I like the sliding cover that helps protect the lenses mechanism  When I hold the camera ready to shoot my fingers falls naturally away from the lenses  flash or any other area that might interfere with normal camera operation  This can be important when you are having a person unfamiliar with the camera take a shot for you  Think about the times you have had to tell someone 133 148watch where your fingers are placed 148 as they were trying to take a picture of you  There are not an overwhelming number of buttons to deal with when taking or viewing pictures  The zoom is only a 3x  but it is a true 3x and not a silly Digital zoom  One note about the zoom  it will not zoom in or out while the flash is recharging  Taking pictures themselves is pretty much point and shoot mode  which is good for those not familiar with the camera  The 2600 is not especially quick in taking a picture when a flash is needed  taking up to 5 seconds between shots depending on the distance of the previous shot  That 146s right  I said the distance of the previous shot  Give this a try 133take a flash picture of something across the room 133now take a flash picture of your hand 133notice that the flash will be ready much faster after taking the picture of your hand strange  I am no expert  but I suspect it is using less flash power for the closer picture  thus the faster recharge time  One thing you need to watch is the fact that in auto flash mode the camera will take a picture whether the flash is ready or not  In forced flash mode the camera will not take a picture until the flash is ready  You really need to hold the camera steady for a split second longer to make sure the camera has taken a steady shot  I would say that approximately one picture out of thirty or so is unexpectedly blurred if you are not careful  I usually have anyone taking pictures for me take an extra shot just to be safe  The fact that you can take around 150 shots on a 128meg Smart Media chip at highest quality makes that possible  The 16meg chip only takes approx 20 shots so I personally would recommend purchasing a larger chip  I have seen come people use the lower resolution modes to get more pictures on a 16meg chip  but why the heck pay for a 2megapixel camera and use the 1megapixel mode all the time The rechargeable 1700mAh Ni MH batteries will last for hundreds of shots per charge depending on the condition of the batteries  how the flash  view screen and zoom are used and whether you are using the power saver mode  Also  there is no battery power gauge other than the one that tells you when the battery is low  I would definitely recommend a second set of batteries since you need to wait until the Ni MH batteries are discharged before recharging The video mode quality is low so you probably won 146t use it unless it is the only option  I have used the video mode one time when I only had my 2600 because of space considerations and saw something that was too good to pass up  So it can come in handy The batteries and Smart Media chip share the same compartment  which is only slightly annoying when changing the memory chip on the move since the door itself only holds the batteries in The software used to connect the camera to the computer is pretty easy to operate and compares well with similar units  A word about the toughness of the camera  I used the camera for approximately a year in a harsh desert environment with only one problem near the end of that year  One single grain of sand made its way into the very inner lenses  This caused a small dark spot on pictures that were focused away  such as scenery shots  Considering what I put the camera through it was not too unexpected to have that happen  Other than that the camera has performed well  
Camera, I bought this camera a year ago to take pictures of things I sell on Ebay I was very impressed with the macro feature This is a must for taking super close up pictures of things like proof marks serial numbers ect Not only do I use it for selling I use it for all my photo taking on trips as well as around home The camera uses floppy disc s and that is great imagine how many floppy s you can carry in your pocket and when you download them on your computer  you can erase them and start all over again I can t imagine how much money I have saved by printing my own photo s and not buying film or paying for developing I recommend this camera highly as with all Sony equipment br br  
Auto, I have driven two different 2002 Subaru Foresters in the past year because my first one saved my life   How It All Started  It all started a year ago when I was graduated college  I was looking to get a new car to commute to work  I had a 1990 Honda Civic wagon that I liked because it had lots of room and got good miles per gallon  36  I was originally favored getting another Honda Civic because I would be traveling 50 miles to work everyday and I could save gas  However  being engaged to a woman who loved me very much  and didn t want anything to happen to me  I decided to look at safer cars  The Forester really was head and shoulders above anything else I had seen  The price was low  22 000  the gas mileage was good for a car like that  26 mpg hwy  and it was safe  more on that later  In addition  it had all wheel drive  perfect for those New England winters  The dealership  Tristate Subaru in Webster  Mass  sealed the deal with their kindness and informed staff   Initial Impressions  The car was roomy  It s not as luxurious as a Volvo  but it really is comfortable  I noticed that the engine is silent especially when idle  This is really nice for sleeping children  The car has some pickup  as you will find out later  came in real handy  and it will seem jerky at first  The driving is smooth and stable  You can feel the car s weight shift if you take a corner hard  but never do I feel the car is going to tip  The cargo space it ok  not as much as a Volvo  but certainly noteworthy  My only complaint in this phase was it corners wider than most cars I m used to  The Honda wagon I had cornered real tight  and even my mom s Volvo wagon turned tighter  I m not too good at lining up parking spaces  because I took my tight turning radius for granted   The Accident  This is the event that ensured that I will buy Subarus until they go out of business or until they go down in quality  A fully loaded septic truck with two porta potties on the back hit me driver s side while I was pulling into my driveway  The truck driver  I estimate  was going between 25 30 mph  although I have been told that there s a good chance it could have been faster  when he hit me  I was waiting for oncoming traffic to clear while making a left turn into my driveway  When the last car cleared  I noticed out of my rear view mirror that the truck coming down the hill behind me wasn t going to be able to stop  I had already committed to the turn  so I decided to  gun it  into the driveway before he could hit me  Well  the truck driver swerved into the oncoming lane in order to avoid hitting me in the back  just as I was gunning it into the driveway and hit me driver s side in the rear door  He would have hit me on my door if the car didn t have the pickup it did  You can see the damage from these pics http webpages charter net defensor Aug28 08 jpg http webpages charter net defensor Aug28 09 jpg Here are the pics from the scene to show just how far the truck dragged the car sideways http webpages charter net defensor Aug28 05 jpg http webpages charter net defensor Aug28 06 jpg http webpages charter net defensor Aug28 07 jpg To make a long story short  this is what I learned about my car from this accident  It was strong  That truck was going fast and hit me straight on  I had a little neck stiffness from the initial impact  but the car surprisingly absorbed that really well  Besides that I had a bruise on my side  You see the damage to the car and it s mind boggling  I wish I would have taken a picture of the inside because besides a little broken glass  someone could have easily survived if they were sitting in the rear driver s side seat  The car was totaled  but I was alive  The other thing was I learned that the pickup in the car is there if you need it  I might have had more bruises if the truck had actually hit me on my door  I obviously got another 2002 Subaru Forester to replace this one  The depreciation was only  2 000 after piling on 10 000 miles in just over 3 months   Other Stuff I Missed  This car is good in snow  Real fun to drive in snow  It has held up well so far even though I only have 22 000 on my second  so I don t know how it will drive after 100 000 miles b Overall Verdict  If you like sports cars and weaving in and out of traffic and impressing women  you probably won t like this car  If you have kids and a family  or just want to be able to survive an accident  BUY THIS CAR  I can t stress this enough  I m not a rich guy  but this is the best  most reliable car I have ever driven  I can t imagine buying any other car  If you want hard info about the car  I suggest visiting a site like Edmunds com because I don t have that info readily available  I go back to the dealership for services and whatnot every month or so  and the dealers there have told me that the printout from my accident photos have sold them dozens of Foresters  I m happy about that  
Camera,   Included in the box is the Minolta DiMAGE X20 camera  8MB memory card  2 AA batteries  a wrist and neck strap  cables for televisions and computers  two discs and instructions  Although this will depend on the place of purchase and deals  The Minolta DiMAGE X20 is very stylish  with its ultra slim body and fashionable look which will suit anyone s age  from the cool teenager to the trendy grandparents  The front looks very nice and the back contains the LCD screen and easy control buttons  The body is very sleek but not too small  When switched on  the Minolta DiMAGE X20 lights up in various places and produces a sound which is very cool  The LCD screen immediately goes into picture mode and you are ready to go  There are two main settings  picture and movie  easily changed by a switch on th top  Both are easy to use and the amount used or stored does depend on the size of memory card  The first thing to do is read the manual quickly to learn the basics then set up the menu  such as date and time  etc  There is a playback button which allows you to view all your pictures and movies One of my favourite features is the voice memo which allows you to record a voice message with each picture  which is a brilliant feature  Another is the movie mode which most cameras will have nowadays but it is good to use from time to time as I have found it quite useful  All movies can be viewed on the LCD screen or when connected to the TV The good points are its overall shape and ease of use  Its very glam and has many features  The camera uses AA batteries which is useful as rechargeable ones can be bought or they can be taken out the nearest control without missing the picture opportunity  The zoom is very good and has a bright flash  The quality and size of pictures can be adjusted to your preference and unwanted pictures or movies can be deleted easily  When connected to the computer  the memory card can be loaded onto the computer so there is more storage  The picture quality is good for the user but a professional would probably buy a more expernisive one  The price is not too bad either and deals are often around so I would suggest searching The bad points are that some things are not mentioned in the instruction book such as how to remove the voice memo from a picture  although this can be found online  Also a case is not included I would recommend buying a battery charger and spare sets of batteries incase the other ones run out  This will save money in the long term and are not expensive to buy  Buying a case will protect the camera and these can be bought anywhere This is a fantastic little camera and would recommend to anyone who is considering it  
Auto, I purchased this truck in November of 1998  When searching for a new 4 wheel drive quality and price were the first considerations but comfort was also very important  Not only does this truck have a haul tow option that improves engine performance but it rides like a luxury sedan  The ergonomic adjustment in both front seats gives total back support and comfort for those long drives  the drivers ability to reach all controls with ease and the added options of extra ac dc outlets allows adding a laptop and cell phone and a charger or numerous other devices that can be used all at the same time  With all the power you can ask for from the vortex engine and excellent gas mileage driving this truck for the last year has been a pleasure  I also think the third door makes shopping so much earier and the rear seat is incredibly roomy br br  
Auto, I have owned my 93 J30t since I learned to drive  actually a little before its the car I took my test in  I will keep my J30 until it falls apart  which could probably be forever given the reliability to date  I do my own oil changes every 3k miles and all other routine maintenance  it has only been to the shop once for a timing belt  I have 120 000 miles on the clock and have no reason to doubt I could get another 120 000 more The car s performance is excellent and after spending a few hundred dollars at Jim Wolf Technology  www jimwolftechnology com  is even better with a high flow air intake and upgraded computer chip which has boosted the HP by about 30 or so  My car now beats most other four doors on the road and even gives a few sportier cars a good run for their money  The main caveat for this car is the same as for any rear wheel drive car  take it easy on slippery surfaces  the back end is fairly light and the car needs to be handled with finesse My friend relatives from europe  where the J30 is not available  always beg me to drive it and have all made me offers to take mine back home with them The J30 owes a lot of it s performance and handling to the 300zx which has the same engine  normally aspirated  and handling systems such as the four wheel HICAS steering system  Nissan Infiniti made a big mistake taking this car off the market  as they did with the 300zx  let s hope it s successor due out next year is as much as a success     
Auto, MY EXPERIENCE I test drove a Saturn Ion 2 5 speed sedan at a local dealership  My test drive lasted over half an hour  and covered city streets  winding secondary roads  and the freeway  PERFORMANCE A theme which you ll quickly notice developing in this review is that Saturn got all the big stuff right with the Ion  but tends to hiccup on the details  For example  the engine  The Ion s 2 2 liter four cylinder is torquey and robust feeling  and it provided plenty of low end grunt for effortless around town acceleration on my test drive  When I wound up the engine on a freeway on ramp  it provided healthy midrange response and pulled the car up to speed with ease  But eager it s not there s something about this engine that makes the revs climb and fall with sloth like lethargy  as if the flywheel was two sizes too big  The power is there  but the engine doesn t zing to the redline like those in the Honda Civic and Mazda 3  TRANSMISSION CLUTCH The Ion s transmission was also a mixed bag  On one hand  I loved the shifter  Its throws were short  and its gates well defined  so the lever thunked from gear to gear with reassuring solidity and precision  But the clutch was a bit disappointing  It has a short throw  which should make it feel sporty  but its vague take up makes it difficult to change gears smoothly  As much as I liked the transmission s shift action  the jerky starts resulting from the tricky clutch take up were a bit embarrassing  Maybe it would get easier with familiarity  something I admittedly had little opportunity to build on my half hour test drive  STEERING HANDLING This is the area where the Ion s  big stuff right  little stuff wrong  dichotomy reaches its peak  Good news first  the Ion s chassis is a solid and capable handler  Its suspension kept body lean well controlled in tight corners  and the tires provided plenty of grip on twisty roads  Driven hard  the Ion felt more surefooted and confident than most of its economy car rivals  But the bad news is that the Ion s steering is among the worst I ve experienced in a new car  It s an electrically assisted system  as opposed to the hydraulic systems in most cars  and the software needs some rethinking to give it the natural feeling response of more conventional setups  Its weighting is feather light  and its ratio is extremely quick meaning that it takes very little effort or movement to turn the wheels  This is great for one finger parking  but the system is also more than a little vague around the straight ahead position  making the Ion feel touchy and nervous on the road  On the freeway  the steering required what I consider more than acceptable concentration to avoid zig zagging in my lane  I ll admit that I m a stickler for steering feel  so this flaw may not seem as glaring to most drivers as it did to me  But if I were actually in the market for another new car  the Ion s misguided steering would have been enough to prevent me from purchasing it  The silver lining here is that  since the system is electric and not hydraulic  it will be far easier for Saturn to reprogram it and make improvements to it in the near future  RIDE Here s one aspect of the Ion that is unquestionably positive  The Ion had an excellent ride  with a suspension that managed to smother bumps effectively while maintaining good control of body motions  There was a bit more floating over dips and rises than you d find in a Honda Civic  but it never became uncomfortably bouncy  and most buyers will appreciate the added softness  Road and wind noise were kept to a minimum  which gave the Ion a very quiet freeway ride  The engine became a bit vocal when I revved it hard  but under normal circumstances it was pleasantly muted  These solid  quiet ride characteristics gave the Ion a  big car  feel that lent it a sense of quality  INTERIOR The automotive press has griped at length about the Ion s youthful  forward looking cabin  but I had no such complaints  In fact  I liked the Ion s interior more than those of most other cars in its class  Where most economy cars strive for a simple  familiar interior design that is unlikely to offend anyone s aesthetic sensibilities  the Ion surrounds its driver in funky  modern styling that may have less mass appeal  but is considerably more interesting  The Ion s dashboard is molded in warm sand dune colors  and it was covered in unusual dimpled textures that were pleasing to my Gen Y aethetic sense  The plastics felt hard and a bit cheap in places  but there was nothing egregious in evidence  The Ion s gauge pod is mounted in the center of the dashboard  instead of directly in front of the driver  and while some people dislike this feature  I appreciated the wide open  unobstructed view forward that the relocated gauges provide  There were only two weak points in the Ion s interior  One is the seats  which were far from uncomfortable  but felt a bit short on padding and support  The other was the thoroughly aggravating shift light  which illuminated in bright orange every time I exceeded 2500 rpms  Driving that way helps save gas  which I m all for  but sometimes acceleration is nice too like when you re merging with freeway traffic  If I want to be told when to shift  I ll drive an automatic  OK    PRACTICALITY The Ion meets or surpasses its competition in this area  as well  The interior felt roomy and provided plenty of space for passengers  The rear seat  in particular  seemed uncommonly spacious for an economy sedan  The trunk also provided unexpected capacity  and standard split folding rear seats allow you to expand the cargo area for bulkier loads  One other feature I appreciated was the height adjustable driver s seat  which is standard on the Ion 2 trim level  RELIABILITY Consumer Reports rates the Ion s reliability Above Average  and did the same for its predecessor  the S series  Saturn s small cars seem to be pretty trouble free machines  so you re not likely to get into trouble here  OVERALL Despite the negativity of much of my review  I really wanted to love the Saturn  and give it my whole hearted recommendation  The simple reason was that the customer service at the Saturn dealership was hands down the best I have ever experienced  Being a car obsessed college student  I go to a whole lot of dealerships to drive new cars  and put up with the same shtick at each and every one  A salesperson accosts me within seconds of arriving on the lot  rushes me through a test drive  and upon returning to the dealership  sends me into the manager s lair for a more thorough interrogation  These have been the tactics at nearly every dealership I ve been to except Saturn s  At the Saturn dealer  what I found was a lot full of unlocked cars  without a single prowling salesperson to be found  I poked around the interior of the car I drove for at least fifteen minutes  with no harassment  When I was just about to start looking for a salesperson can you imagine someone walked up and asked if I needed any help  When I asked for a test drive  he said   A test drive  Sure  Here s the key  Take your time  just call if you re going to be more than a half hour  Oh  and while you re out  try to take some city streets and some freeways  too  so you really get a feel for how it drives  I was stunned  And I certainly had plenty of time to get a feel for the way the Ion drives  although the unfortunate answer is  not spectacularly  The onslaught of aggravations from the steering and drivetrain dooms the Ion to automotive mediocrity in my view  despite its strengths in other areas  So it comes down to this  what s more important to you  the driving experience or the buying experience  If your biggest concern is avoiding pushy and confrontational salespeople  Saturn is the way to go  If you re more concerned with the car itself  you may want to keep looking  
Auto, Let me say first of all  this is the best car I have ever owned  It has required less work and drives better than the others  Of course  the others were a 72 Plymouth  an 84 Pontiac and a 88 Ford Tempo  This car is head and shoulders above those I recently had to replace the water pump and that is the only major thing that has gone wrong with the vehicle since I bought it in the summer of 1998  The front tires tend to wear a bit and the suspension does squeak sometimes  Also the rubber lining around the doors is prone to falling off  and the doors often need a shot of wd 40  The car does have 82 000 miles on it however and it does get me where I want to go  I haven t driven it very far however  but it is a fairly reliable car and has never left me stranded  I hope to get another 20 000 miles out of it  For me  the Corsica has been a good car and a good investment  If you are looking for something to get around town  this car will do the job br br  
Auto, I purchased a Durango in February and it s been a pleasure ever since  The truck is solid  I have the large v8 option and it accelerates without any hesitation  Gas is a problem  it does guzzle  The leather trim inside is awesome and you feel like you own a quality car when you are inside  I have had no problems with the truck  I would recommend getting the 3rd seat option for anyone who buys this vehicle  family or not  It is a cheap and convenient option for the family who even just occasionally has to pack an extra bunch of passengers to the little league game  The sound system is very good and the steering wheel controls are very convenient  You will like this truck if you have ever driven an SUV  I also own a 4Runner  Toyota  and the Durango is a lot more fun to drive  The pick up is superior and the interior is definitely roomier  I would recommend this truck to anyone who thinks they should get a MINIVAN  This is a lot more practical and MUCH cooler looking  I have found it hard to hate anything about the vehicle but it could improve a bit on the center console  No big deal but I prefer more room to store stuff  The back seats are very roomy for the kids and they love their own cup holders  If you do not like a STIFF ride  stay away from this vehicle  The engine is loud  My least favorite feature is the mileage but I knew that before I bought  Take this car for a test drive and you will be sold Please rate my review br br  
Camera, Love Olympus 35mm cameras but DL 600 is a dog  Good pictures but glitchy downloads on PC and extremely poor on Mac  Software with the camera is poor but not not the whole problem  Will not download to any PC or Mac laptop I have tried it with  After 1 1 2 years it has been back for repair twice  Second out of warranty fix required  150 check to get them to look at it  They wouldn t accept a PO from a  400M NYSE listed company  Just think what they would do for a private individual By the way they have had the camera for 2 weeks now and still can t tell me how much to fix or when I can expect to see it again br br  
Camera, After my Canon Powershot 300 died in a puddle in the bilge of a sailboat  I went in to the local camera ship to replace it  I was looking for something similar  a compact point and shoot digital camera  I figured I d upgrade to 4 megapixels  which is no problem since most of the newer compact cameras offer this level of resolution  I did have a look at the new Pentax Optio S  known as the camera that  fits in an Altoids tin  but  frankly  it s just too small  I was looking at the new Canon Powershot 400  telling the story of how the last one died  and the sales guy showed me the Olympus  I have been very happy with the Canon  and they have a reputation for excellent image quality  so I was a bit reluctant to try a different make  but after he showed me the water  and dust resistant seals on all the openings  ports  battery  etc  on the Olympus  I was sold  I travel quite a bit  and the fact that stray dust  sand  salt  and water won t get into the innards of the camera is very attractive  Of course  this is not a waterproof camera  you cannot immerse it  for that you need a waterproof housing  but I don t know of any other manufacturer that has put this sort of attention into their stock compact camera housings  water  and dust  resistant design  all the openings have rubber gaskets so that the camera won t die if splashed or dropped in a puddle  The gaskets also prevent sand and dust from getting into the innards  design  very sexy  and certainly small and light enough  I checked out the new Pentax Optio S  which is known as the camera that fits in an Altoids tin   the thing is just too small  unless you have very small hands  I would love a camera that light  4 ounces instead of  8 ounces for the Olympus  but not quite that small  unless they can make the controls a bit larger  user interface  relatively easy to figure out  quick to navigate  and the features don t get lost in the shuffle  I did a quick read of the manual  and now I remember  and use  many of the features regularly  and this is after only 10 days  USB drivers  the camera s USB interface is set up so that the camera appears to the computer just like a removable drive  so it doesn t require any special software to copy images from the camera to the PC  4 megapixel resolution  both SHQ  super high quality  and HQ  high quality  images end up at 2272x1704 pixels  HQ eat about 1Mb each  SHQ s about 2 5Mb each  This means that my 128Mb XD card will hold about 128 HQ pics or about 50 SHQ s  night shooting mode  permits exposures up to 4 seconds  In combination with the self timer or remote control  and possibly a tiny little portable tripod  you can do some fun stuff at night with this camera  remote control  comes with the camera  allowing remote shutter release  Of course  you can just use the self timer  but the remote is a nice touch    picture quality  seems quite good  although I have not printed anything yet    XD memory card format  why another new format  XD is only a little smaller than SD  XD s backers say that it s faster and the spec can handle larger capacities than SD  but I doubt there s actually any difference    battery life  seems fine  I ll update the review once I have more detail  As usual  there is no detailed battery level indicator    the battery charger has a cord  If you re familiar with the Canon cameras  their battery chargers simply plug directly into the wall socket  without a cord  saving a bit of space and tangle in your travel bag  If you need a cord  you can always use an extension  A small point  but I prefer no cord    no audio or voice recording function  would be nice

Camera, This is an unwieldy  Jerk  amongst today s IT cameras  Powerful  YES  Capable  YES  Slow  YES  Most of all you will notice the quirky  look  and downright wierd design shell in particular the placements of controls  Yes  all of Sony s ergonomic specialist must have been away on holiday during THIS development  For example  I can t get my finger to the  joystick  control when I hold it to my eye because my nose rests smack on it  I have actually managed to access the menus using my  beak  instead  This is a  hidden feature   the SONY  beak controlled menu  At least SONY has not yet advertised it as   Sniff out all Sony s new babble babble More examples  The auto manual focus button that I often use is IDENTICAL and next to the steady shot on off that I seldom change  Thanks to my trusty DREMEL 20 000 rpm drill they are no longer confusable to my  finger spits The shutter button is recessed and therefore hard to find in a hurry  A nice little  blob  of self curing adhesive acrylic fixed that for good  Also severe problems with the  manual  exposure controls that I can only find if I can see them   so forget adjusting exposure manually with the camera to your eye  Unfortunately these controls are just too tiny to fix with drill or acrylic  blob  The three pod screw is laughable so use the camera handheld However  I a very happy that I can use 2 3 disks  simultaneously  for different types of pictures like work  sport and family  It takes no time to change disks as required  and no need to fill one disk before you change as with film  Only Hasselblad offer this with it s  famous  replaceable film cassettes  However  the properties like exposure does of course not change as with different film speeds The fact the CD is not rewritable compatible does not worry me one bit as long as  crook  pictures can be deleted  with lost disk space  at the low low cost of each 8cm CD disks  and no need to muck around with cables and software  just pop the disk in the computer drive and ENJOY a full screen of image pleasure  Here on the computer is were I do the picture adjustments and size cropping  The camera provides the option of  digital zoom  for the many silly  Jerks  amongst its users  There is no such thing as a  digital zoom  really  it s actually an  in camera frame cropping  that may just save a bit of cheap disk space  Why would you pay good money for a Hi Res pickup of 2 3 million pixels and then only use a 30  in the middle with this silly  zoomey  camera cropping  Only Jerks use the digital zoom option and it s a shame its there on a camera with such good optics like on this SONY product  Forgetaboutit Next model needs BIGGER controls logically arranged and a non slip ergonomic rubber ring around the lens  Also a standard flash shoe for  standard  photoflashes and or a ring flash would be really wonderful  Yes  the inbuilt pop up flash can best be described as a practical joke if you use it for any macro situation  Ha ha ha  very funny  You Sony people really know to enjoy the Japanese brand of humor  Guess I m lucky to be spared the surprice cockroaches This camera sets a bewildering  world record  for poorly executed human design in conjunction with a really good brand new revolutionary concept  I bet a German or Dutch brand would not commit such careless sloppy  crime  or  
Auto, The VE30DE engine came standard in 92 94 SE Maximas  This DOHC engine produes 190HP and 190ft lb of torque to give this maxima a 0 60mph time of only 6 7 seconds  This is very impressive for such a luxurious four door sedan like the Maxima  This engine was one of the first to used variable timing in the cam shaft  This was called VTC in the maximas and later copied in other makes of cars including Honda VTEC  The 93 Maxima SE is a great vehicle  very fast while very comfortable  Everyone should own one of these to truely experience VE Power  It is nicely equipped with a 200 watt BOSE sound system standard in the SE model     
Auto, Picture this You re in your new black 2000 civic ex with your moonroof  front and passenger windows all rolled down since it a clear day with a slight breeze You re going about 70mph and all u can hear is the music of the Beastie Boys blaring from ur new car If this is the image that u are looking to convey feel free to call your nearest Honda dealership  This car is certainly an accomplishment  It actually set the pace for the other honda cars because of it sporty  sleek look  They have done a fabulous job on the craftsmanship of the interior by adding an AM FM stereo cd player w clock and 6 speakers not to mention a readable tachometer  since these two are the most important features of the full honda driving experience  What else do u do while you re stuck in traffic averaging only traveling a distance of 5 miles in the last hour its probably something with those two features not to mention the AC especially in the TEXAS heat  This is not the only thing that got my attention from going to a toyota or mazda Actually  what caught my eye was the shape  style  and the endless possiblities of adding modifications since that  50000 dollar lexus is out of my student range  The civic is still equipped with enough horsepower that can allow it handle any Dallas traffic situation even in slick conditions since it comes equipped with ABS  With all this in mind  I was very satisfied with the final cost of this vehicle  This car does have all these benefits but I would have to recommend to people with large families they invest in a larger  roomier car such as the Accord or Camry  By the way I LOVE DRIVING this car br br  
Auto, The Beach Boys really knew what they were talking  or singing  about when they said the T Bird was  quot fun  fun  fun quot  Even if I DIDN T live near the beach in Fort Lauderdale  I would love to cruise around town in my silver Thunderbird Believe it or not  I DIDN T buy this car  it was a gift from some special friends  yah  VERY special  huh  But after driving this one I WOULD buy one in the future Whether in heavy city traffic or on the freeway  my T bird drives very nicely and has so much  quot pep quot  that I have to watch very carefully to  quot keep the foot off the pedal quot  and not land myself in trouble  It drives so smoothly that driving at 60 65 MPH actually FEELS more like 45  Got to keep that eye on the speedometer driving this thing  or you ll end up with a ticket   The seats are very comfortable  with plenty of leg room  I m tall  Back seat also has quite a bit of leg room and is comfortable  Good circulation of air conditioner  even in back seat One thing I especially like about this car is that it  quot turns on a dime quot  This is especially helpful if you life in the city and frequently need to make turns in small spaces or U turns  yes  it s LEGAL in Fort Lauderdale    Even though it s a bit larger car than I m used to  I find it as easy to drive as the smaller models Maybe I am showing my age   but the only type of person I would NOT recommend the Thunderbird for is someone who lacks the discipline and self control to drive it right  Speeders and  quot rage aholics quot  etc  had best stick with something a bit more sedate  But otherwise   if you want a  quot dream car quot    this is it br br  
Auto, I was looking for a nice size family car at a good price  After looking at a lot of different brands and models I chose the Poniac Grand Am SE  It is a really nice car for the price  Well worth the money  It has a semi sporty appearance  drives and rides really smooth  and is great on gas  From the outside it does not appear to be very big  However  I was really impressed with the amount of room inside the car  definately deceiving  My husband is very tall and has no problem at all getting and in and has enough leg room to be comfortable One of the great features it is equipped with is a type of safely lock so that once you lock the doors to get out there is a 30 second delay before it locks incase you have accidently left your keys inside you still have time to get them out On the down side  one feature that does not appeal to me is the passenger side seat  in the 2 door model  Once you slide the seat forward to let a passenger into the back the seat has to be slide completely back as far as it will go to a locking position and then repositioned where you want it  The seat does not slide bvack very easily to the locking position  I have found that it is very hard for someone small or elderly to do  If the seat is not properly locked into place  hen driving down the road to stop it slides forward with no warning br br  
Auto, The Dodge Ram still stands out in a crowd  Even though the style is 6 years old  and both Ford and GM have redesigned their trucks  the Dodge Ram will still grab peoples attention  The Interior is very spacious  The Ram is the only standard cab truck I have found that you can have the seat bottom moved all the way back and still reclign the seat back  You don t get the impression that you are about to eat the steering wheel  There is plenty of space for 3 people in the front  The 5 2L V 8 comes standard in the 4x4  This engine has a long history in various Mopar vehicles  It is known for its reliability  durability and power  I have towed trailers that were over the max towing rating for the 1500 and you hardly notice that the trailer is back there  The drivetrain and suspension are over engineered  meaning that the 1 2 ton 1500 Ram could easily handle payloads and trailers that most others would use a 3 4 ton truck to carry  The Ram is the only 1 2 ton 4x4 truck in the U S  that has a solid  live  front axle  This is another example of it s ruggedness  see Fords 3 4 ton SuperDuty trucks  The ride and handling of the 4x4 1500 Ram is stiff can t compare to a car  but then the Ram isn t a car  If you put a load of about 500lbs in the bed of this truck you will notice that the ride is much smoother  The first thing I did after buying the Ram was to replace all the shock absorbers and the steering stabilizer with quality aftermarket units  This made a dramatic difference in the ride  with no bad effects on handling when the truck is fully maxed out in payload  This truck is for people who want a real truck with real truck capabilities  If you are looking for a vehicle that can handle bad terrain  carry over max rating payloads  and tow a house  this is your vehicle  If you are looking for a car with a big open trunk  then I would suggest looking elsewhere br br  
Camera,  A Note to the Reader  It 146s been over a year since I 146ve last written a genuine review  and I undoubtedly feel odd as my fingers begin to move over the keyboard again  the way they used to  As Stephen King would say  I too  have been accused of  147diarrhea of the word processor 148  and this piece is embarrassingly long  I 146ve tried to give this review a very personal touch  which I trust you will enjoy  Miniature reviews of three other cameras are added to depict the progress of my research Where applicable  links to sample photos in my photo gallery are provided  I recommend using a separate browser to access these links  and to read the review at the same time  All the photos are very large  but load relatively quickly  even on slow connections  If the links do not work  I would be grateful if you informed me of the problem in your comment  If  on the other hand  Geocities protests and says I 146ve exceeded my bandwidth limit  then please bookmark this review and visit the links approximately 1 hour later 133if this has happened  I apologize i b A Bit of History  The month of September 2002 could have been described as a month of change 133the month when I began collecting old bottles 133collecting cacti and succulents 133and it was also the month during which I literally grew up in a day  Initially  I had little interest in cars  and even less interest in learning how to drive  But that tiny spark turned into a warm fire overnight  and I fell in love with a  Jaguar XJ6  133an elegant car with a leaping cat ornament adorning its bonnet  A photo of this mascot would grace my profile today  if Geocities actually got its act together My interest in digital cameras however  dates back as far as the beginning of the year 2000  At this time  I was intrigued by the little metal boxes my friends carried around  Costing over a thousand bucks apiece  the devices produced excellent photos  had nifty controls  and allowed the user to instantly delete mediocre photos to save on memory space  This was something that I had never seen before in a film camera  But the sheer cost of these beasts made me stick to my simple  point and shoot  Konica U Mini  that was actually a free gift from an unknown package But it was soon clear that I had missed out on many prospective photos  solely because I had taken little pride in my photography  and never had a decent camera with me when I needed it most  Interested to form a portfolio  of animal ailments and parasites  among other things  on my computer  a search for that  147perfect 148 camera ensued 133 b Glossary of Technical Jargon 133for Your Morbid Pleasure  It is a pain to listen to a photography freak  especially if one does not understand some basic terms  Learning these may help you put these fanatics in their place  together with the false wine  147experts 148  who know much less about wine than themselves  A sales representative may fare better than me  but I thought to include a small list here for the sake of convenience b CCD   An abbreviation for Charge Coupled Device  a sensor that separates the colors of the scene into red  green and blue  allowing the camera to process it  After the CCD captures the black and white image  this is passed through red  green and blue filters to produce color images b ISO   An abbreviation for International Standardization Organization  It refers to the relative sensitivity of film to light  A higher ISO depicts a faster film that is more sensitive to light  Digital cameras do not have film  per se   but these ISO ratings are still used in an identical fashion for the sake of ease  While a higher ISO setting allows the capture of images under lower light conditions  it increases the amount of grain or noise  Sample taken at ISO 400  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 GunNoise JPG  in your image b LCD   An abbreviation for Liquid Crystal Display  Most digital cameras have this color screen on its reverse side  and is mostly used to review captured images or as a viewfinder to compose an image  deciding how and where you wish to take the photo  Since memory is the limiting feature on all cameras  poor images should be deleted immediately  The resolution of the LCD is measured in pixels  a higher number of pixels resulting in a sharper image on the screen  In my opinion  a digital camera without an LCD must be avoided like a plague b Macro   A function that allows the camera to capture a high resolution image even when the tip of the lens is very near the subject  and is used by naturalists  researchers and hobbyists to photograph small objects such as insects  flowers  Sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 NorthBalwynMumsPetunas jpg  coins  stamps and small animals  Sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 Chippy7DaysOld jpg  Many cameras have this function  though with varying degrees of efficacy  More specialized cameras can capture excellent images even when the tip of the lens is very near the subject  Citing an example  the  Ricoh Caplio RR30  has a  1cm Macro 148 function that takes excellent photos even when the lens is 1 centimeter away from the subject b Mega Burst  Continuous Shooting   Allows the rapid capture of multiple images of the same scene  This creates a slow motion sequence and allows you to observe the strokes in fast ball games such as badminton  basketball and soccer  The rate of shooting is measured in frames  in the case of cameras  this term refers to images  per second  FPS  Based on my current knowledge  a lower FPS rate represents slower shooting  with the capture of fewer images over the same period of time b Megabyte  MB b  One million bytes  a measure of the storage capacity of a digital camera  The form of storage may be internal  or in the form of a flash memory card  A higher amount of memory allows you to take more photos on those long holiday trips when you cannot regularly transfer images onto your computer b Megapixel   One million pixels  A higher pixel rating represents a larger image that has a higher resolution when compared to low megapixel images  High megapixel images  two megapixels and above  can be blown up to a larger size with less loss of quality  Low megapixel  one megapixel or less  images will be perfect on greeting cards  but certainly not on A4 sized paper  I recommend that one purchases a 2 megapixel camera  at the very least b Noise   A term used to the point of nausea by some professionals  Images are theoretically silent  but Noise tends to make images  particularly nightshots  appear grainy b Pixelation  Pixelization  Jaggies   Pixels are a collection of small dots that together make up a digital image  As pixel size increases  the jagged or angled edges between adjacent pixels become more obvious  Sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 RSPCAPixelation jpg b Red Eye   In darker conditions  the pupils of eyes of all living creatures dilate  widens  to take in more light  When the flash is used at this time  light reflects off the insides of the eye  making it appear red in photographs  The red eye reduction system utilizes a flash of light which causes the pupils to constrict before the photo is taken  reducing the chances of red eye in the final image b White Balance   This control adjusts the settings of the camera to match the natural or artificial light source in the scene  allowing the camera to reproduce the colors more accurately in the image b Digital Zoom   This is not a genuine zoom function  The camera digitally magnifies the scene by interpolating  adding pixels to the image  pixels  rather than with the help of optical lenses  The image thus becomes grainier and loses optical quality  Digital Zoom is measured in increasing multiples such as 2X  two times  3X  three times  and so on  in a similar fashion to magnification b Optical Zoom   This is a genuine zoom function that is performed with the aid of optical lenses  There is no resulting loss of quality  Cameras that have an Optical Zoom cost much more than those with only a Digital Zoom  partly because of the additional moving parts  I believe that even amateur photographers should purchase a camera with an Optical Zoom i Note   Optical and Digital Zoom can be combined to achieve the maximum zoom on an image  For example  if a camera has a 3X Optical Zoom and a 2 5X Digital Zoom  the total zoom is 7 5X b FujiFilm Axia Slimshot  On 8th November  which was the worst time to get distracted  as my finals had only just begun  my attention was drawn to a segment of a brochure featuring this camera  It was cheap  when compared to other cameras  and extremely compact  The credit card sized camera was only 6mm thick  and had a decent internal memory of 8MB Unfortunately  it had no flash and no LCD screen  two things which were deemed mandatory by a more experienced friend  The camera also has no Optical or Digital Zoom  and captures 640 X 480 pixel images  working out to a mere 307 200 pixels  or 0 307 megapixels  which makes it unsuitable except for the most casual of all photographers b Kodak EasyShare CX4200  The final exam was over on 27th November  and I would have gone straight to the shops after leaving the examination hall  if my Mum had not held me back  she told me to save my money instead  The  Kodak EasyShare CX4200  is an easy to use  2 megapixel camera  is endowed with a 2X Digital Zoom  and has a respectable storage capacity of 16MB  This seemed attractive initially  because it was well within my budget However  the camera has no Optical Zoom Once I had reached this stage  my Dad was convinced I had gone mad 133yet again  Though he didn 146t stop me  he wasn 146t keen to watch me make a poor purchase and blow off hundreds of dollars in the process  so he handed me some glossy brochures   147If you want to buy a camera  make sure you do your research first 148  said he 133I was glad I did b Ricoh Caplio RR30  This was the third camera I researched  Though the pricing was a little over my budget  its macro function intrigued me  the camera can photograph objects as near as 1cm away from the lens  The  Ricoh Caplio RR30  is surprisingly low priced  considering it is a 3 megapixel camera  capable of 3X Optical Zoom  and has negligible shutter lag  allowing it to capture images in rapid succession But research soon revealed that besides its macro mode  fast shutter release and possibly the included rechargeable batteries  there was little to recommend about this camera  The images were noisy  and were imbued with a strange blue tinge  which was even more apparent in nightshots b Canon PowerShot A40  It took a long while before I finally started researching on this camera  I had ignored it initially  because it seemed expensive when compared to other cameras in its class  and the mediocre information in the brochures pushed me to believe that this was an ordinary device  with nothing to get excited about  Despite this   Canon  proved the worth of this camera  and eventually pocketed my money i In Brief  The  Canon PowerShot A40  is a  2 megapixel   effective  camera  running on  4 standard AA batteries   rather than proprietary ones  with a  3X Optical Zoom  and a  2 5X Digital Zoom  Function  It features a  Manual  Mode  which allows the user to control the shutter speed and aperture size  and the interesting  Stitch Assist  Mode for the production of panoramic photos  In addition to this  the camera also boasts a  Movie  Mode which allows the capture of short clips with audio  it is most amazing to find this feature on a cheaper camera It communicates with the computer only via the  USB port   At this time  the camera is compatible with  Windows 98    Windows ME    Windows 2000    Windows XP   as well as  Mac OS 8 6 through to 9 1  and  Mac OS X 10 1 5 or later   thanks to  placebo3  for correcting me on an error I made in this section i What 146s Included i   Canon PowerShot A40    Software  Canon Solution Disk Version 8 0   ArcSoft Camera Suite 1 1 b   Canon PowerShot A30  A40 Camera User Guide   179 pages This thick manual looks very daunting  but is actually well structured and easy to comprehend  It includes an excellent contents page  a Quick Start section  and a comprehensive Specification list as well as an index  Nearly all sections are laden with diagrams or images to aid learning   Canon Software Starter Guide   114 pages This guide is very well done indeed  The information is well organized and all the intricacies of the included software are explained in impeccable detail   Interface Cable IFC 300PCU  This connects your camera to the computer  via the USB port   AV Cable AVC DC100  The cable links your camera together with your television set  I used this feature to present photos to my family and relatives on the night of 16th December   CompactFlash Card FC 8M  The camera does not have any internal memory  and stores images in a flash memory card  The included card has a capacity of 8MB   Wrist Strap WS 200  This simple contraption allowed me to fasten the camera securely to my wrist during the first few days  when I didn 146t have a camera case   4 AA Alkaline Batteries   single use These batteries won 146t last very long  and are expensive to replace  It is estimated that only 200 images can be captured  if the LCD screen is turned on  The optional  Canon  NiMH  Nickel Metal Hydride  rechargeable batteries would last for 350 images under the same conditions  It is recommended to purchase these or use your existing NiMH rechargeable batteries  NiCd  Nickel Cadmium  batteries are not recommended because of their short battery life and are unreliable   System Map  This green sheet shows a diagram of the included as well as optional accessories that are available for your camera  It also provides a list of the printers that are capable of utilizing the camera 146s  Direct Print  function  Once the compatible printer is connected to the camera via a cable  images can be printed immediately by using the camera controls i First Impression  The  Canon PowerShot A40  is an all plastic  metallic grey camera  Measuring 11 03cm X 7 1cm X 3 76cm  W X H X D respectively  it is easy to hold in one hand  but is too large for most pockets  Weighing 250g  without batteries  this camera is no lightweight  The construction is exceptionally resilient  and I believe it will withstand the stresses of my future trips to farms or during clinical rounds i The Top  This is a relatively uninteresting side which features only the logo   147PowerShot A40 148 and the  Shutter  button  The latter is also termed a  147two stage shutter release 148  the industry standard  When pressed halfway  the camera focuses on the image and adjusts the white balance and exposure  Once this is done  the camera beeps  The button can then be depressed fully to capture the image i The Front  When viewed from the front  the battery compartment protrudes very markedly on the left  but I find this increasingly useful as a handgrip The  lens  resides around the middle of this side  and can be fitted with optional accessories such as the  Wide Converter   for taking wide angle  when zoomed out  shots   Tele Converter   a magnifying lens to aid telephoto  when zoomed in  shots  and the  Close Up Lens   for taking macro shots  This camera features a built in lens cover and eliminates the worry of losing it  especially in  147haystacks 148  such as those in my unkempt room The  microphone  is situated above the lens and records sound monaurally when the camera is in  Movie  mode  The optical viewfinder is positioned to the left of the microphone At the top right hand corner of the front face is the  flash  compartment  which is constructed ingeniously because it incorporates an orange red light that functions as an  AF assist beam   helps the camera focus  especially in dark conditions  a  red eye reduction lamp  or a  self timer lamp  While we are still viewing the camera from the front  let 146s proceed to review the left and right sides i The Left Side  There are few features on this side  except for a compartment for the CompactFlash  CF  Card  and a separate compartment for a CR2016 battery  this should last about three years from the date of installation  if not more  which functions to retain the date  and time  The wrist strap eyelet is positioned above the CF Card compartment i The Right Side  Hidden underneath a durable rubber flap are three main features which I will discuss in order from top to bottom   Digital  Terminal  When fitted with the included cable  this port allows the camera to communicate with the computer via its USB port  Overall  communication speeds are excellent   A V Out  Terminal  If the camera is connected to your television via the included cable while you are reviewing your images or video clips  they will appear on the television screen instead of the LCD  The video output signal can be switched between NTSC and PAL as required   DC In  Terminal  With an optional adapter kit  the camera can be connected to an external power source to allow extended use of the camera without having to stop to change the batteries i The Back  The screen is perhaps the most evident feature on this side  It is a  TFT color LCD   displaying images at a resolution of 120 000 pixels  This screen performs well under most conditions  is brightly lit  clear  and allows an accurate review and framing of images  Under dimmer conditions  the LCD begins to look grainy  but this has no effect on the final image  The viewable area is a mere 3 1cm  and I was certainly expecting a larger screen on this camera The  optical viewfinder  rests above the LCD screen  I rarely use this unless my batteries are running too low to turn on the LCD  The two  LED indicators  to the left of the viewfinder are used to remind the user of the current shooting mode  warns that the camera is shaking  or depicts that the camera is busy Underneath the screen are four buttons which I will discuss from left to right   Set  Flash  button  Use it to set features in the various menus or to toggle between the flash settings when taking photos   Left  directional button  Toggle between the  Continous Shooting Mode  and the  Self Timer Mode   This functions as a left button when reviewing images or exploring menus   Right  directional button  Toggle between  Macro   Sample  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery DandenongRangesFlower jpg   Snapshot   Sample  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery GreatOceanRoadGrotto2 jpg  and  Landscape   Sample  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery GreatOceanRoadThe12Apostles jpg   infinity  modes  While reviewing images or looking through menus  this button is used to move to the right   Menu  button  Brings up a variety of menus  which vary according to the shooting mode or review mode  The key features of this button are to adjust the  image resolution   1600 X 1200  1024 X 768 or 640 X 480  degree of  compression   superfine  fine and normal  with superfine representing the lowest compression and a higher quality image  changing the  ISO   the settings available are 50  100  200  400  Auto  and to set the  Light Metering Mode   Evaluative or Spot Metering To the right of the screen are three buttons  From top to bottom  these are the   Display  button  Used to turn the LCD on or off  or to display detailed information while shooting or reviewing images  In the latter case  this makes it possible to see what camera settings were used to capture an image  and then learn how to adjust the settings accordingly to achieve a better photograph in the future   Exposure Compensation    White Balance    Photo Effect  and  Erase  button  When shooting in bright daylight  or against a strongly backlit area  the  Exposure  can be adjusted between  2  the captured image becomes darker  and 2  lets more light in and brightens the image  in 1 3 step increments   White Balance  can be adjusted depending on the nature of the light source  some examples of which are  147Daylight 148   147Cloudy 148

FruitOff JPG   On  Off  button  A nifty silver button that does just what it says  It would be a pain to do without it At the right most end of this side is the  Mode Dial   which allows you to choose between the following operating modes   Replay   Review the images that are stored on your CF Card  This is the mode to use when you intend to download images from your camera onto your computer   Auto   This shooting mode turns your camera into a point and shoot device  The camera does the light metering  ISO settings and white balance automatically  This is the best mode to use if you need to take photos immediately after taking the camera out of its box  The downside is that photo effects such as  147sepia 148 are not available   Program AE  P b  Only the shutter speed and aperture size are set by the camera  Other functions such as ISO  white balance  photo effects and light metering are set by the user  I find this mode sufficient for all photos taken during the day   Manual  M b  A mode for more experienced users  it allows for the manual adjustment of the  shutter speed   ranges from 1 1500 of a second for brightly lit scenes to 15 seconds for dimmer areas  and the  aperture size   a choice of two values between F2 8 and F14 are available at any zoom setting  The  Manual  mode is fast becoming my favorite as it allows me to express myself  and is particularly useful for evening  Sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 NorthBalwynEasternFreeway jpg  and nightshots   Stitch Assist Mode   This intriguing feature allows the capture of a sequence of images  from left to right or vice versa  which can then be stitched together into a panoramic photo  Samples  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery GreatOceanRoadLookout2Panoramic jpg  with the  Photostitch  software that is supplied with the camera  Thus far  I 146ve created two panoramic images in this way  and I 146m impressed at how accurately the software can appose adjacent images   Movie Mode   The camera can capture short movie clips at about 20 FPS  At a higher resolution of 320 X 240  the camera records for a maximum of 10 seconds  For longer movie clips  the lower resolution of 160 X 120 allows you to record clips up to 30 seconds long  Recording ceases automatically when the time frame elapses  or if your CF Card becomes full  whichever occurs first  The movies are also recorded with audio  making it handy for videoing short demonstrations The last  but not least  feature on this side is  Zoom button  that is used to activate the digital and optical zoom  While reviewing images  the user can also use this button to magnify the image by up to ten times  and then panning across the image using the  left  and  right  directional buttons i The Bottom  Only the battery compartment cover and the tripod socket are seen in this area b Software  Two CDs are included in the package  one being the  Canon Digital Camera Solution Disk  and the other is the  ArcSoft Camera Suite 1 1   The software is compatible with both Windows and most Macintosh Operating systems  as mentioned above The  Canon Digital Camera Solution Disk  includes   TWAIN Driver   A driver file that allows the computer to recognize your camera to allow for downloading of images   Zoombrowser EX   The program allows the downloading of camera images onto the computer  organization in a chronological fashion to form a  Time Tunnel   images are arranged in a simulated tunnel  according to their creation date  which can be zoomed forward or backward as though one were moving through time  converting the camera 146s RAW file format into BMP files  this function is redundant since all images on the camera are already in a JPEG format can be opened with  Paint   and resize images to create email attachments   PhotoRecord   The main feature of this program is to let the user create electronic photo albums  adding words to describe the image or a personal experience   PhotoStitch   As mentioned before  the program takes the images  shot with the  Stitch Assist Mode   arranges them  and turns them into a panoramic photo  It is accurate  and easy to use  The stitched edges are only vaguely apparent in areas where movement occurred while the photo was taken   RemoteCapture   When the camera is connected to your computer  the program lets you control the camera 146s shutter button and basic settings remotely from the computer  and images are downloaded immediately onto your computer instead of the CF Card The  ArcSoft Camera Suite  CD contains   ArcSoft PhotoImpression   It can be described  quite simply as a jazzed up version of the regular  Paint  program on your computer  With this  one can edit images by cropping it  enhancement  sharpen  blur e t c  or via the addition of special effects  The program is very functional and intuitive  and certainly much less of a pain to use than the comparatively primitive  Paint    ArcSoft VideoImpression   This ingenious program allows the user to compile several short movie clips or still images into a movie with dramatic transitions  select from a list of dissolve  wipe  special or fancy effects  and also provides a feature for editing and removing any unwanted frames b Conclusion  Now that you 146ve come this far  let 146s summarize this review and get this over with as quickly and painlessly as possible i The Good 133    Excellent image quality   allowing the production of outstanding photos  every time   Durable construction  ensures that the camera will outlast some of the tougher challenges   Feature packed  yet easy to use  giving even the newest photographers a chance to get their hobby on the road   Manual Mode  leaves the user with lots of room to grow and experiment   Software bundle  was well thought out  filled with features and very user friendly   Noise reduction  system was exceptional and all the photos I took appeared to have little or no grain at all  The camera utilizes special processing techniques to reduce noise in images that are taken at shutter speeds slower than 1 3 seconds  This  however  requires a length of processing time which must elapse before the next image can be captured   Instruction manuals  are well organized well presented i The Bad and the Ugly 133   I was shocked when I opened the box  only to realize this camera didn 146t come with a  Camera Case   Since I was due to go sightseeing with my relatives immediately  I depended heavily on the wrist strap for a firm grip  The included  CompactFlash Card  has a capacity of only 8MB  too small for its own good  I recommend purchasing a 64MB card  stores about 64 images  even at the finest quality  which is sufficient for longer trips away from home  It is unfortunate that no  rechargeable batteries  and  charger  were provided  A  four directional pad  instead of just a left and right button would 146ve made reviewing and panning through images a lot easier  The  LCD  is a little too small  even though this isn 146t a serious flaw  Images are stored in a  JPEG format   a compression which results in a smaller file  but also causes the loss of some detail  I would have preferred the camera to store the image in a RAW format  no detail is lost  which can then be converted to a standard BMP file on the computer   Shutter lag  is quite noticeable  causing some delay  about 1 second  before another photo can be taken Overall  this camera would make an excellent tool for beginners and hobbyists  but also leaves them with much room to grow  For its price  the  Canon PowerShot A40  is surprisingly powerful and outshines many cameras in the 2 megapixel category  If you are new to the world of digital photography  this is the camera I 146d highly recommend b Further Reading  b

Camera, I was not much of a photographer  but my Sony Mavica FD73 changed my life  Digital cameras are an excellent way to take share and store memories  Instead of a shoebox full of crumbled and bent glossies  I now have a folder full of files  Not only can I view the photos when I want  but I can email them to friends and family  It is fast and fun and the best way to keep friends updated on your activities  I have some friends who regularly send baby photos via email and I always know how the toddler is growing even though we live states away  I think the best aspect of the digital camera is the instant processing You take a shot and can view it from the camera  No need to wait for prints  If you didn t capture the scene you wanted  you simply take the picture again  Plus  you can delete all of the bad photos of yourself without anyone knowing It is so user friendly  The screen is easy to use and it is very easy to tab from one menu to another  I prefer Sony because you can instantly take the disk to your computer and email it to a friend or print the image  No file conversions  no waiting  Quick and easy  Software comes with the camera  The new battery technology is getting better and you can charge the battery to last for hours  You will definitely wish to invest in a small camera bag I bought a refurbished camera from the manufacturer and have had no problems with my camera  Buying a refurbished camera saved me a couple hundred bucks     
Camera, To start off  this is not a camera for serious photographers  this is a great tech geek toy with mainstream crossover potential   In English  it looks cool  and it 146s easy to use  If you take this out on the street  heads will turn  People will come ask you what it is  It looks awesome  Your dog will respect you more  You may be promoted  It 146s that cool  And realistically  they can 146t make them much smaller  or there won 146t be anything to hold on to  so you 146ve reached coolness nirvana  With sound This is not to say it doesn 146t take good pictures  I 146ve been fairly pleased with the output  Some of the other reviews can address the technical specs and such  as I don 146t know a whole lot about them  But on the whole  the pictures I 146ve taken are uniformly better than the pictures I 146ve taken with old fashioned 35mm cameras  I bought the camera purely as a point and click device and it works great  What sold me on this model was the size and 30 second videos with sounds  and I 146ve been real happy with the output there Some of the cool stuff  The menus are easy to figure out  Configuring the settings takes a little getting used to and a bit of tweaking  but you can generally get pictures you like without too much effort  The movies are pretty cool  And the picture on the viewscreen is excellent  It 146s a 1 6 148 screen  which is generally enough to frame the pictures you want  But to reiterate  the coolest thing about this thing is the size  It 146s comes about a millimeter short of fitting inside an Altoids tin  and it 146s thinner Some of the downsides  First off  cost  Not just the unit  which is pricey on its own  but the dang memory cards  I 146m sure these will come down over time  but for right now  the SecureDisk cards it needs are expensive  One of the consequences of this is that you won 146t want to use the MP3 player functionality much because you 146ll want the space for high quality pictures As for storage space  with the high quality pics I like  you can get about 160 or so on a 128 MB card  The lowest quality size combo here will fit about 1500 in the same space   There are three different sizes  1600x1200  1280 x 960 and 640x480  and three qualities  Fine  Normal and Economy If you 146re cheap  you can get by for a while on the native 12MB memory  which is also pretty cool Oh  and did I mention it 146s an MP3 player  While this is kinda cool on paper  and while showing it off  I haven 146t used this yet  and don 146t expect to  unless the cards become free  It does come with a nice remote for the mp3 functionality  with readout and all  but it seems a bit tacked on  It 146s almost like this is just too much While the pictures are great straight on  once you start using the zoom  they get pretty fuzzy  It goes to 4x digital zoom  and the picture starts to degrade fairly quickly I 146m also constantly afraid I 146m going to lose it  I lose my keys all the time  and they 146re way bigger than this is  As for the movies  I 146ve been pretty impressed  but the size is limiting  While 30 seconds is generally long enough to get what I want  the maximum size is 320x240  That 146s just pretty tiny  Still  quality is ok The software that ships with the camera is ok  The Photo Loader is a convenient archive  but the Photo Editor is a waste  The cradle is nice and small though  and it has USB connectivity  so I can plug it straight into my keyboard  Nice feature I 146ve been VERY pleased with the battery life  If you 146re fairly conservative  i e  turning it off after you take a picture  you can go a few weeks without a charge And that about sums it up  There are a lot of features here I didn 146t cover  Some are things I don 146t use  like the ability to take audio notes  or annotate photos with sounds  some are things I just don 146t have comments on  like the Best Shot feature  which sets up the camera for certain shots automatically  On the whole  this camera is an excellent purchase  I 146m glad I got it  It defines portability  and now I have a camera with me everywhere I go If you 146ve got the cash for it  and are just looking for some point and click fun  this is for you  
Camera, 1  Can you see the picture of the camera direct on TV using AV cable  I think elph has NTSC output  where as here it is Ixus V with PAL color video out Yes  There is a proprietary cable that connect the elph to TV  USB or the Canon printer  The TV output is on normal RCA jacks  one more for mono sound since this can take small movies  It can output both PAL and NTSC  Mine is set obviously on ntsc  Ixus V is the same   my manual has that on it too  2  Can you record the audio of the picture  few seconds Yes  I need to get a big memory stick  I am waiting for deals to show up  The resolution is not that great in video mode  Sound sensitivity is pretty good for the size of the camera  3  Have you synchronized the camera direct with PC using serial port or USB Only USB comes with it  I have left the usb cable attached and just plug the camera back and forth 4  How many pictures you can take per minute or what is the time required to take consecutive pictures This is not a professional camera at all  It does take a second or so before it takes the pictures  Usually I can do around one picture every 2 seconds  It does have continuous picture mode  but that does not work real well   fast enough  I do not have exact numbers 5  The memory stick size you have 8M or 16M or both  Can the memory stick keep the pictures if you remove it out of he camera and for how long Mem stick is called the Compact Flash   available from anyone  I do not recommend the Memory stick  because as Betamax  it is proprietary Sony technology  and eventually  they will have to keep up with Compact Flash and the other memory flash product  This is flash memory so it stays good all the time  I can use the same card in other cameras and move it back to my camera and still continue using it  I have 8m  I get a free 16m that I will apply for  rebate  And in a couple of weeks   Jan or so  I will buy a 80 96 or 128mb card 7  Can you resize the photo direct from the camera by panning and tilting the picture for editing before saving it to the memory Only thing camera can do is rotate pics  Everything else is done on the computer  The coolest program is one that stitches pictures together  That way  I can get a good panoramic picture 8  Can you also change the resolution of the camera after picture has been taken at highest resolution No  Only view it 9  any more useful experience Many  The flash is tiny  If I take a picture indoors  the flash only illuminates the item if it is within 3 feet  else it looks real bad  Also  everyone still gets red eye  Indoor  also has a problem with good balancing  Also  many pictures were coming out to be blurred  Was disappointed with results in low light  Outdoor pics are much nicer  10  What is the battery type Lith ion and what is the capacity  How often you need to recharge Lith ion  Since operation requires that you use the lcd  it eats up after around a 100 pictures  after which I have to recharge  11  The TFT screen is the color screen visible in day light Yes  It is quite bright and high res  I do like the camera  It does have its flaws  which do not allow for professional to semi professional photography  Also  the lcd does not have a protective cover  which I think is really dumb  Last  the curvature of the flash and red eye flash make it impossible to clean if dust comes on it  Last  it is made in Japan  
Camera,  The Mavica became so frustrating I didn t want to use it anymore b It wasn t the camera s fault  It was mine for not fully investigating the function of the camera and for not matching my purchase to my shooting style  Though the Nikon Coolpix series doesn t sport the fancy add ons like the CD writer or image stabilization  the 950 would fit my photography and my habits where the Mavica CD1000 does not  This is my followup review  you can read my original Mavica CD1000 review from the list below b For starters  the wide angle can hardly be called wide  I brought the CD1000 with me on my recent trip to Europe  I spent two weeks walking around and seeing the sights  most of it without the Sony  Why  Sheer frustration at the lens and my inability to capture any wide views  I ve often thought of switching from my Nikons to Canon EOS just so I could use their amazing 20 35 2 8 zoom as I think that may be my ideal walking lens I see the world through a very wide field of view and that s how I also like to shoot  I prefer the sense of perspective from a sharp but not exaggerated wide angle  The barrel distortion on the Mavica was simply too much for me and I put the camera away in my luggage with barely a few shots taken The Sony CD1000 sports a measly 39mm SLR equivalent lens  My standard SLR lenses are a 24 and a 105  how could I be happy with a maximum wide view of 39  I was hoping the wide angle adapter would help  but poor image quality and horrible viginetting left me wondering at how blind I was to drop  1500 on a system that I can t consider functional b It s all about personal preference  For those digital shooters coming over from the Sony camcorder world  the Mavica will make you feel right at home  Everyone I showed the CD1000 initially thought it was a video camera  To me  the long telephoto attached to the still camera just doesn t seem like a good idea considering the inherent delays make capturing sports images impossible  I would much prefer a wider view and less range on the zoom I like to shoot from the hip and the Nikon Coolpix seems so much more flexible with it s rotating body  The large Sony just felt clunky and hard to get a good grip on  not to mention the pitiful manual focus ring  In summary  my CD1000 is for sale  including the external flash  no complaints  and the wide angle adapter Bid now  low reserve   http cgi ebay com aw cgi eBayISAPI dll ViewItem amp item 469259888   
Auto, I think that this vehicle is a blessing in itself  Besides a great interior availiable with many different options the exterior looks awesome  My best friend s is equipped with pretty much everything like ac  power EVERYTHING  and it even came with a pioneer stereo system  It was one of the smoothest and the greatest rides I have had in a long time  I mean  I didn t even hear the tahoe start up  If I had to choose a vehicle over the one I already want then this would be it br br  
Auto, After many years of Honda devotion  we re now part of the VW family  We ve had a 2000 Passat Wagon for 5 weeks now and we love it  and here s why  keep in mind that we ve been driving a 1990 Honda Civic hatchback for 10 years  Turbo rocks  The car s natural peppiness is helping me in my attempt at curtailing my turbonium indulgence  It has nice handles  Sure  the door handles are comfortable  but the attention to detail really shows itself in little things like the cargo area cover s handle  which is covered by a little flap to keep riff raff from peeking in through the handle at your stuff  and the hinged above the door handles  which snap up out of the way when not in use  After an afternoon parked in the sun  we can turn and hold the key in the driver s side door to open all the windows and let out the hot air  Turning and holding the other way closes all the windows plus the sunroof  I find myself  quot forgetting quot  to close windows before getting out of the car just so I can do this  though once the engine s turned off  you still have some time to close the power windows  Driving at night is an aesthetic experience  The panel lights are blue  The dealer told us it s for ergonomic reasons  but we suspect it s really because it looks cool  I like playing with the trip computer  It s entertaining  I watch my instantaneous mileage go from 12mpg uphill to 56mpg down the back of the hill  It s a competition  I try to keep average mileage as high as possible  It s informative  How far and how long was this trip Here are my gripes  The key is enormous  It feels like I ve got a big rock in my pants pocket  The Cruise controls are clumsy  They re clustered on the turn signal stick in such a way that  after peering around the steering wheel  drifting into a brief visit with the road shoulder  to figure out where they are  you ve got to take one hand from the steering wheel to adjust it  trying it with your hands still on the wheel results in flashing your bright headlights  The glove compartment is big enough for the VW manual you get  but not much else  There are plenty of other compartments throughout the car for stashing maps and such  but we d prefer to keep them all together  The front cup holder is terrible  It flips out at an angle  toward the passenger seat  obscuring the ashtray  which is the best place we ve found for keeping change  so approaching a tollbooth with the cup holder out is a harrowing experience  It s shallow with rubber grippers inside  to keep the cups snug  Too snug  as it turns out  since we can t wrestle styrofoam coffee cups and aluminum cans from the holder without spilling and cursing  We now take 2 cups when ordering coffee  one cup stays in the holder and becomes the actual holder of the full cup  On our car the trim panel on the inside of the back cargo lid is loose  After a visit to the dealer  it s still loose  They ve threatened to replace the whole  quot back end quot  whatever that means I m known to buy stuff based solely on its design  the experience it affords  its attention to detail  Now that I m living with the car  I m learning where that attention to detail slipped  But in spite of the gripes above  I ll repeat myself  we love it br br  
Auto, I bought a Corolla in 1995  It was my first car and is still my only car  My parents purchased the car for me because it was relatively cheap  and much more sturdy than a Honda Civic  Toyota Corolla is probably one of the most reliable cars anyone can purchase  I would recommend that parents buy their children this car to ensure their safety and general well being  My Corolla has only broken down once in five years  and that was due to a problem with my alternator  I have had a few flat tires  but never any major problems  Maintaining a Corolla is pretty inexpensive  Corolla parts are expensive  since it is a foreign car  However it is rare that you will ever have to replace any parts except for routine tune ups and maintanence  I love driving my Corolla because it has an excellent stereo system  My uncle owns a BMW and his stereo does not sound as great as mine  I recently installed a six  cd changer  and the stereo surround is almost as great as my home stereo system  I also find the car very easy to handle and manuever  My brakes are also excellent  however  no matter how new your brakes are they still squeak  I have also been in two minor accidents  and my car has only been slightly dented  Who would think that a little car like the Corolla would stand up to sturdier cars This car is a definite buy for students  people living on limited income  and people who want to keep their cars for a very long time  This car is great on gas  especially since gas prices have skyrocketed br br  
Auto, I leased my Jetta because my grandparents only purchased Volkswagens and swore by them  I loved the car for the first year I drove it  I thought it drove well and was very comfortable  About a year and a half into the lease  however  it all started  The first thing to go was my alternator  I lost power while driving on the parkway and thankfully was able to get out of the flow of traffic safely  Since then I have replaced all of the moldings on the car once and currently have 2 missing because I refuse to keep paying for them and Volkswagen will not assist  I have also had to replace the rear passenger window motor   even though it had rarely been used  Recently I have had to replace the ignition switch twice  The latest nightmare is the locks  The drivers side lock does not work all the time and sometimes when I use it the alarm will go off and I cannot get it to stop  I am extremely disappointed with my Jetta  I never now what is going to happen next  I will not buy or lease another Volkswagen  I had a Honda before this for 6 years and 130 000 miles and only had to have normal maintenance performed  This car has been a money pit for me     
Camera, When I first started looking a digital cameras  I didn t know that much about them  I am much more familiar with 35mm slr s and medium format cameras  I will try to pass on what I have learned and why I think the  Hewlett Packard Photo Smart C30  is a good deal When looking for a digital camera  I believe you need to look for several major features  The first of which is the resolution  or the amount of pixels that are contained in a photograph Pixels are kind of like the the grain of a negative  The more pixels you have  the better the photo will hold together when you try to enlarge a photograph  The same is true with a negative  The more smaller the grain  or the more you have basically  the better the image enlarges  The HP C30 has one megapixel resolution  1152x872  This is the resolution at its highest setting  There are three settings on this camera  Each setting progressively reduces the amount of resolution that a photo contains  This is a great feature when you are trying to save room on your memory card This leads to the second thing you need to look for when deciding on a digital camera  The memory of a digital camera is in essence the film you are shooting your photos on  Some of the cheaper cameras do not have a removable or upgrade able memory card The HP C30 I bought came with a 8MB Compact Flash card  The memory card is about one and half inches square  This makes in convenient if you want to carry more than one card  The memory cards can also be bought with more memory allowing you to store more photos with out having to change the card or downloading images  You can store 17 superfine images  40 fine images  and 80 basic images Another very important thing to look at when deciding which digital camera to buy is the way in which you download photos to the PC  The HP C30 is downloaded to the computer through you serial port  The camera comes with a 9 pin serial PC cable  This is slow process and I think it is the major drawback of this camera  A USB download would have been much more beneficial Additionally  you want to be aware of the type of power source that it needs  If you buy a camera that is a battery guzzler  you can be out of luck when you really need it or want it  The HP C30 uses four AA batteries  If I buy good alkaline batteries  I get much longer use of the camera before I have to change them  Hewlett Packard estimates that the camera s battery life is like this  500 photos without a flash  and 200 photos with a flash  I would say that this a pretty good estimate Lastly  in identifying a good digital camera in my opinion is what kind of accessories the camera comes with  this includes the software  This camera came with Microsoft Picture It  and HP Photo Smart Photo Finishing Software  I personally love the HP software  It makes downloading the photos very easy  This program is also good when balancing color and exposure  Another great part of this program is the way it allows you to print the photos  It s got a great feature called paper saver  allowing you get the most out of your photo printing paper One thing to look for is an LCD display  but I don t believe that it is as important  This is usually for a preview post view display  The HP C30 comes with a 1 8 quot  color display  Although using it to take the picture is a little hard  This is due to the fact that it is not like a typical video camera image but refreshes the image every second  making the image appear to skip around Another great feature of this camera is the fact that you can display your images on a television  The camera comes with a cable that can be hooked into the television  Then you can slide show the photos in your camera  In addition  you can record the slide show onto a video tape to create easy and lasting memories  or to torment your family and friend with  I do recommend using the ac adapter while doing this so as not to drain your batteries b Overall this is a great camera for the money b  I did buy this camera about a year ago  and at the time it was the biggest bang for the buck  I think in comparing digital cameras today that are available  that it is still is a great buy b Here are the specs 1 megapixel resolution 2x digital zoom 24 bit color ISO 100 exposure system Mechanical shutter 1 500 to 4 seconds Color 1 8 quot  LCD display Normal focus 2  to infinity Macro focus 10 quot  to 2 NTSC Pal video connection Dimensions 5 w X3 15 h X1 9 d in Weight 68lbs  without batteries Minimum Host PC Requirements 486 66 Mhz or faster CPU  Pentium recommended for NT 4 0 For use with Microsoft Windows 95 98 and NT 4 0 16 MB RAM  32 MB recommended 20 MB available disk space for HP PhotoSmart photo finishing software 80 MB available work disk space recommended 90 MB available disk space for creative software CD ROM drive  4x speed recommended 256 color monitor  16 bit or higher recommended  br br  
Camera, I ve been wanting to get a digital camera for a while  because it s convenient and I ve been using Zing com quite a bit to post pictures to share with friends and family  I want a good quality camera but I don t think I need a 3 3Mpixels  2 1 is a good price quality point  I read reviews and specs on a few cameras and decided to go with Canon  mainly because I m a big Canon 35mm SLR fan  owned the ElanIIe for 5 years  got it when it first came out  and I also have the APS Elph Jr  got it as a birthday gift  and I love them First  this camera looks GOOD  It s silver which matches my ElanIIe and my Elph Jr  and it s the same size as its APS brother  It s very easy to use  I never had to read the manual  I m very pleased with the quality of the pictures  It comes with a lot of useful software and I like the USB PnP functionalities  My girlfriend  loves  this camera  definitely a really cool toy I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery  this saves me a lot of money  and the battery charger is really cool However  there is a few disadvantages NO CAMERA CASE  my digital elph costs around  100 and it came with a case that fits the camera perfectly  I can t believe a  500 camera can t include a case  However the digital elph fits in the elph jr s case 8MB is not enough  need to get a 32MB SanDisk flash card   60 at Amazon No power adapter  it d be useful to have one  but not really necessary If you go on trips and likes using the LCD to take pictures  u d definitely need an extra rechargeable battery br br  
Auto, Recently our 12 year old Nissan Stanza decided it was time to retire so my wife and I went out car shopping  we ended up buying a 2003 KIA Spectra  It seemed like a nice car  fit and finish is good and the factory stereo sounds really nice for a oem job  We now have 9000 miles on it and the engine is just starting to get broke in  The power and mileage was poorer than I had thought it should be but now it is coming to life  we get about 31MPG  as long as we keep our feet out of it  with the Automatic and it can hold it s own on the freeway  There are a couple drawbacks to freeway driving  the road noise on concrete and older pavement surfaces is really bad  we had to install thick floor mats to help dampen this out and it is still loud  Also if you plan to put two adults in the back seat be advised that the little KIA will want to wander side to side as the front end gets a bit light from the weight of the rear occupants  The ride quality is pretty good  the seats are comfy and it has very ample leg room so long drives aren t too bad  just keep the stereo up a bit to cancel the road noise  I do my own oil changes on a lift so I had a chance to check out the underside of my KIA  most of it looks pretty good down there except for the rear axle mounts  they look to me a bit on the small side  The automatic transmission is a bit on the shift happy side  it shifts to overdrive at any speed even at 25 mph  this makes the engine sound like it is lugging a bit  I usually keep the transmission out of overdrive in town  One nice thing about the interior are all the little nick nacks KIA has engineered into it  the overhead sunglass holder is just neat  as are the individual map lights  The cup holders are adjustable in size and the little cubby in the rear of the center console is nice since the top of the lid also opens up to store small items  All in all it isn t a bad little car for the money  would I buy one again  I think not  Should you  Depends on your prioraties  
Camera, I always do a lot of research before I buy anything  anymore  We re talking weeks worth  on the internet  in stores  reading reviews and so on  I needed a digital camera because my scanner died and I need to get pictures on the web for my business  Honestly  I hate having to wait to get them developed also so this worked out for the best I don t use all the features of the camera  In fact I probably use only the very basic ones but that s really all I need  I pretty much just click and shoot a picture  take it to the computer and download it For those very basic things it s been just great  I like that I can see the pictures as I m taking them and scroll through them to see if I took a bad one  The camera takes great pictures  the person pushing the button  me needs a lot of help  I take this camera everywhere with me and put the pictures up on web pages or send through the email  I bought the camera on sale at Best Buy for  300 00 and it came with an 8mb card and I got a 16mb card free  I haven t opened the extra card yet  I picked this camera over a Kodak and I think a Vivitar  My friends that use it keep asking how many more pictures they can take on it  but it s displayed on the camera and it s almost 200 pictures  They re still used to having to change film  I m sure that if I dug out my book and read up on all the features I would love this camera even more  The camera is easy to use and the instruction booklet easy to follow  One bad thing  It eats up batteries like crazy  I finally decided to buy a battery recharger and keep 3 sets of batteries on hand at a time for it  Now the camera and I get along just fine     
Auto, This car is an all around good buy  If you are into cars  you can really get a lot of extra parts added on to it  It is great for racing and showing off  but if you just need it to drive around   I guess that is ok too  It really is a high quality vehicle  I have had no problems with it and it is still holding up very nicely  It is a great ride and really fun to drive  The best person to buy this would most likely be a guy who is into import cars  It will work for the ladies too though  Acuras are high quality vehicles and I have been impressed with everything about them  My favorite thing about this car is racing  I love to go drag at import car shows and show off my baby  It is already fast and has great handling but can be improved even more br br  
Auto, I waited to write this until I have had 4 months of driving my 2000 KIA Sportage My wife has HONDA CRV and I leased a TOYOTA RAV4 for three years so I have a fair amount of knoledge on SUV s  I got the car in forest green which is really pleasing too the eye and the dealership through in tinting and keyless entry It really is a sharp looking SUV  I am 6 2 and it has the most leg room of any SUV in its class which is kinda interesting since it tends to be a few inches shorter than most SUV S The back seat is tight especially if the front passengers are above 5 9 The interior is very basic and simple so do not look for a lot of bells and whistles  One thing that is interesting is that they did put money into one area using a thick truck frame instead of a car frame Also because it is slightly shorter than most SUV S and the wheelbase is comparable to most  the tipping problem seemes to be lessened I have taken pretty sharp turns and the KIA did not show any signs of tipping The electrical problems that occured in previous years has been fixed so there is no problem there  The engine is solid and comparable to others but goes through a breaking through period where it actually has better pickup a month after you drive it than when off the lot  130HP  a little noisy but no big deal decent pickup but not great If you are used to 6 or 8 cylinders you might be disapointed When it is windy and you are going more than 75 mph on the parkway you will feel it This is not a cadillac or a porsche  it is not for great speed or luxorious comfort It is a great looking very fun to drive car however For around town it is great  and short road trips it is a real pleasure The radio could be better with stations that could come in clearer and the position of the rear speakers even though they are good sounding are very poorly placed The front speakers are interesting with tweaters right by the window for great highs A little trick is to take the covers off the rear speakers My ultimate solution was to get a pair of 6 9 speaker and enclosers for the back and problem solved If you dont know what im talking about and high quality sound is important plenty of places will set help you like circuit city speak to the installers not the salespeople By the way I am now at 8 months and not one problem Lovin this suv  
Auto, I have been a Montero owner since about 1985 and have found these vehicles to be extremely reliable and dependable  I have owned several of them and would buy another  If there is a downside  it is the availability of parts when needed and the dealer network in the Southwest is a bit thin The Montero itself is a tough vehicle compared with its competition and serves well as an off road machine  which is the kind of use that I give it  It is well suited for farm and ranch use as well as for hunting  Generally speaking  it seems to outlast many other sport utilites in its class Properly maintained  it is a strong performer although a bit underpowered for its size and weight Overall  I would recommend that anyone in the market for a true sports utility vehicle put the Montero on their  quot short list quot  to investigate as a long term ownership car that will last a long time As a used vehicle  it is usually underestimated when it is offered with somewhat hight mileage on the odometer most comepetetive sport utes can be consideree pretty well worn at 100k miles a well cared for Montero can be a very good value for the used car buyer who is willing to take the time to check one out  and they are usually available at attractive prices on the used market br br
